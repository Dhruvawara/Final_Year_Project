"°First of all the built quality of trimmer QT4011/15 is good.. °I have tried almost all trimmers from Phillips and to be honest i did not find anything different about this one.. °The common thing about Phillips trimmers is that the blades tend to become blunt after a couple months usage.. °About the adjustable length setting is quite good, but has a small flaw that at lower settings the beard is not cut equally, resulting in areas where length of beard is more and less in other. You will have to do it more carefully and spent more time if you want a flawless look.. °The good thing about this trimmer is that works for a lot of time without charging and charging this thing also takes about a couple of hours. I would have preferred a micro usb type charging system in this one because while travelling i will have to carry an extra charger with me which becomes hectic.. °The range of length selection wheel is till 20mm which can even be used for trimming off your head hairs.. >Conclusion ;. °Overall the trimmer is handy, portable, easy to use. But i would suggest to buy Philips QT4001/15 which is around 500rs less compared to QT4011/15, because even if the precision you will get is less but accuracy is surely good. Furthermore if you like to keep it simple i would suggest BT1210 which comes with micro USB charging system and is even more affordable, portable, easy to use, precise and long lasting.",5
"Excellent Product! I was looking for a clipper to trim body hair. However the option i was getting were for unknown brands or very expensive brands. Then i thought if this trimmer can cut beard hair, then it can also cut body hair . Thus i took the chance and bought the product. I am happy with my decision now . Yes guys this can be used for body manscaping aswell. It worked superbly on chest, underarm , even on pubic hair. However dont use it on the balls :)",5
"Excellent product. I have been using other china brands so far as expensive as 700 to 800 rupees. Finally bought this when a friend of mine recommended. I could notice the difference almost readily when using it. The major advantage is the battery. We can just charge for 60 minutes and use it for more than 100 minutes. Blade quality is excellent. It glides very smooth on the skin without any irritation. This is the best I have used so far.. People who want to buy QT4005, please note that the charge for it is 10 hours and it gives around 40 to 60 minutes usage max.. On the contrary, QT4011 charge time is just 1 hour and you can use it for more than 1.5 to 2 hours. The price difference is just 500 approximately is guess. I would recommended to choose this instead for the long run. Also, if you register online on the philips website, you get 1 year extended warranty, making it a total of 3 years. That's so much great than what I expected.",5
"I have been using this trimmer for more than 2 years now. Since I broke the head comb of my last one, I had to order it again. While reordering I thought of switching to some other trimmer, went through a lot of products but ultimately came back to this. This works well, is affordable and definitely performs exceedingly well. The only problem I feel is that the zero mark trim doesn't really do the job when it comes to trimming to nothing. Overall this is a great product for a reasonable price!",4
"What’s in the Box? – You get the main unit, a small cleaning brush, charger, some documents & manuals, a handy carry bag which is made up of a very light flimsy kind of material.. The packaging differs from product to product as I have seen from some other reviews. Mine came in a brown box, which read Philips Series 3000, manufactured in Indonesia and imported by Philips India. Some other boxes are made in India products I guess. Either way, product is genuine and new and works flawlessly.. Charging - Battery is the biggest advantage of this charger, as you don’t have to charge it again and again. QT4011 charge time is just 1 hour and you can use it for around 1.5 to 2 hours. This is brilliant in my view, compared to some other trimmers which have much more charging time, and working time is actually lesser than this (in similar price range of course). While charging, the power indicator lights up in green color and keeps blinking to signal charging. Only negative that I found was that the charger could have been micro-USB, because with this specially designed charger, you have to carry an extra one while traveling along with your phone charger. Also, in case it’s lost or damaged, it’ll be difficult to find a replacement (maybe).. Performance – Please note that this is a trimmer and not a shaver, so don’t expect a clean shave even at the maximum setting. As a trimmer, it works flawlessly. It has different length settings, and without the combing head, it gives a close trim of up to 0.5 mm. I have used it multiple times to trim my beard at different length settings, and it has given satisfactory results.. The trimmer can be used on chest, underarms, and can even trim pubic hair. However, don’t use it on the balls, can be a bit risky (didn’t try it). The cord length is roughly 2 metres, and is sufficient.. Overall, the trimmer is really handy, portable, battery lasts really long and gives a good trim. You can’t ask for more at this price range. Hope this review helped you in making a decision.",5
"Not a good product from Phillips.. There is a metallic part underneath the self sharpening blades that comes off and has been causing problems ..the clipper comes to a halt with a grinding noise and really unhappy ..as I have to reposition the part again n again .. machine doesn't work even 5 minutes .. WON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS.. Edited Part :. Finally after leaving it un-used for a few months (4-6), got it fixed from local electrician ..and have been using it since without any problems.",4
"I bought it on 28 sept 2015 and after 3 yrs of use ,it still works like a champ. The battery life might have taken a slight hit of about 20 minutes but other than that everything works as good as new.. Shocked to see it still selling so good even after 3 yrs.. Just one thing the POUCH YOU RECEIVE IS VERY VERY BAD.. All in all its is worth every penny.",5
"This is my third trimmer from philips.I wont say that im a great fan of philips or such words but after my second philips trimmer stopped working due to some motor issue eventhough i charged it for 10hrs it used to give me hardly 2minutes trim Time . I thought of buying a new one as i had no hopes on my old trimmer.I took my old trimmer Philips QT-4005/15 to authorised service centre in hyderabad.They charged 200 for it said it will work fine,unfortunately that attempt didn't turn out well,no complaints it served me for 3 years.So i made up my mind to buy a new one.I was so deliberate that i thought i should buy a different trimmer this time and that too not from philips.After going through all the reviews and all the YouTube stuff I didn't find any other trimmer better than this.So i took a u turn came, back and bought this new trimmer.The packaging is very good but i have a small complaint the comb clip which comes with the trimmer doesn't fit well and it seemed to come out off the trimmer.Otherthan that i didn't find any other drawback.Enough of my review,its getting way longer😉",4
The product has stopped working after 3 months of usage. There is rotation sound when i turn on the trimmer but the trimmer blades don't move at all. have tried charging it again also.,1
"i bought this product on 23rd of sept where i used it 2 times as per now. the third time when switch on the product, the battery was low. i plug in the charger and it is not even charging i am really regretting that i bought this product.",1
Not working properly. Top part is not connecting to inner axis. So blade function disabled,1
I already have a phillips trimmer which was only cordless. But unfortunately the adapter is no longer working. Tried a lot to find a charger but these types of adaptor are not so easily available in the market.. So thought to buy a new trimmer with same type of adaptor so that i can use one adaptor for both trimmers.. Here is the clutch. You can use only adaptor model which is made for this trimmer. Cant use this adaptor for any other model of the same brand.. If you face the same problem try getting a trimmer which can be chargerd through USB.. No other negative feedback for trimmer. It was and it is very good in function. Old fan of trimmers. Easy to clean and easy to operate,3
"This was my second purchase of the same model , The first one lasted for 3 years and the product was excellent. This one, though same model, the precision of trimming was not impressive at all, and leaving some beards uncut...you have trim for long time and still not giving the satisfactory outcome",1
It's machine is working but it's blade is not moving contacted many repair shops but no use... I didn't expect this from PHILIP'S,1
I am using this product past 1 or 2 weeks and found it really helpful for my travel and other events. It gives you 0.5mm precision trim and with 20 length setting option. It comes both usage with or without cord.. Battery life: 8/10.. Worth money: 7.5/10. It comes with a good quality travel pouch and the trimmer is easy to handle and use. You can wash it easily. It has titanium blade which has a self sharpening technology.. One think i disliked about the product its that its cord length is not that long. Overall the product is suitable for the beard you have.,4
It hurts.... definitely not skin friendly....... I have been using philips multigroom trimmer for past six......which is about 3000 rupees.....that trimmers are skin friendly.......this one is not.....the only problem with the multigroom trimmer is you can't use it with cord.....& U can only use it cordless.....& That means you have to charge it always..... before use........that could be irritating at many times........ that's y i chose this corded trimmer..... but this trimmer hurts like hell....after 3 month of use editing review and rating........ if you use it carefully.....it could come quite handy....due to its ability to use it while charging,3
My second Philips trimmer and I bought it because of the following reasons. Pros :. 1.Good desisn & build quality. 2.Lightweight and waterproof. 3.3 year warranty. 4.Skin friendly and cut-nick proof blades. 5.Battery lasts about 40mins on a single charge. 6.Multiple trim length settings makes it easy. 7.Works with cord connected and with out,4
"Just see the pictures I shared, I am sure I need not give any explanation. Be careful while buying anything on Amazon. I heard these blade don't rust ever but mine got rusted in just a half years time.. Update: called Philips customer care, they say they don't cover Blade is warranty. Then I am not why they advertise that blade is washable?",1
Not much useful if you want short hairs or want to style the french beard. I was not expecting it to just die in one year of purchase. There is warrenty of 2 yrs. So I will try to get it repaired and see. They do allow pickup from home. Still have to try them.,1
"very bad, i am returning this trimmer because its backaged with small box with philips comapny logo. i think they did fraud on this item to me. even the trimmer charger is missing with item. very bad experience",1
Very disappointed with the product with the brand like Philips and with Amazon as well.. It's really risky while operating the trimmer. It cut the skin as well. I wonder does Amazon believe in Quality check of the product which is listed on their app. And I am sure they're not doing it. Feeling like I m being cheated. Not recommending this product for sure. Pls consider my rating as zero or minus,1
"• it does not require 10 hr charge to use +. • easy to clean and use +. • it does not give clean shave like blades but it does it’s job really good. • trimmer comes with charges, cleaning brush and a carry packet. • with this price you should definitely go for it",4
"I don’t think that there’s much to complaint in this trimmer as it is firstly a very good quality product and secondly does its job very well. I am extremely satisfied with the trimmer and i am gonna tell you why is it so in below simple points.. Trimming with ease – As you can notice in the images I have uploaded of my before and after trimming that the trimmer have done an awesome job in separating the edges of my beard. It cuts even very small hair with ease and gives you the edges almost like the razor cut.. Fast job and super sharp blades – In my experience, the trimmer I was using before was so awful that it took almost 20 to 25 min in trimming my beard as the quality of its blades was scrap. And with this Philips trimmer it took me exactly 4.5 min to trim my beard with its super sharp blades as I have shown in above images.. Awesome battery life – As its shown in the specification the battery life of this trimmer is awesomely 90 minutes and if I talk of my practical use, I had charged it only once since I have bought it in December and used it 6 times till until now in 3 month, and its showing no signs of battery drain yet.. Length settings are mindboggling – The 20 length settings which are given with the detachable comb are truly awesome and useful in actual us. Unlike other trimmers u don’t get set of 3 or 4 detachable combs with this one but you get the setting on trimmer itself which is kind of useful and convenient.. JUIST – THE OVER ALL CUNCLUSION FOR ME IS THAT IT IS AN AWESOME TRIMMER WITH GOOD QUALITY BLADES, AWESOME BATTERY LIFE, FAST TRIMMING EXPERIENCE AND EASY TO CARRY THIS OUTSTATIONS. I LOVED IT DUE TO ITS PERFORMANCE. AND LASTLY YOU HAVE TWO MORE REASONS TO BUY IT FIRSTLY DUE TO THE BRAND NAME ‘PHILIPS’ WITH IT AND THE 2+1 ONE YEARS OF WARRANTY ITS PROVIDED WITH.. PLEASE VOTE HELPFUL IF THIS HONEST REVIEW HELPED YOU IN ANY MANNER.",4
"I got this product on the 20th of January and used just once. It had battery and ran smoothly the 1st time for around 15mins. However when i wanted to use it for the 2nd time , the battery wasnt there and hence i charged iot for more than 3 hrs , but still it didnt get charged and stopped working. Feeling dejected that such highly praised trimmer should not give you the results as expected. Replacement was 10 days only which i missed since i didnt expect it to stop working. Have registered on Philips site fro extended warranty but not sure if there would be any solution . Waste of money...",1
Extremely High price as per the quality of the product.... quality is all okay... but i expected a powerful big machine... and i was very curious to know what are that 20 length settings but... there is nothing like that... expection and excitment was over... i spend 1700Rupees in sale* okay ? and now am thinking why i didn't spend my money on another product... it will be of low cost and same features...,1
I think I received a duplicate product..!. It seems that packaging of this product is not done by Philips. I've purchased many products of Philips but their packaging is different from this packet.,1
"Got in different box.. how to register in Philips site ? No barcode on the box.. charging light is turning off after 1 hour charge . Does it means ,it's fully charged ? Or some issues there.. after reconnecting,it again charges.. but LED again turning off after sometime.",1
"From past 1 and half year I am using this amazing product and its working pretty fine with its long battery life I'm so happy... Pros:. *Philips QT4011/15 comes with a huge battery backup.. *1 hour charge gives u around 100 mins backup.. *Battery light indicator.. *easy to clean.. *length adjustments.. Cons:. *Delicate clip. frankly, must buy product at this price range. With great quality and easy to use and clean after usage,.. for daily use one must've this product and it never hurts ur skin with proper usage and will get slightly warmer some times but its not a problem.Even those Titanium blades doing its job pretty well.. verdict:. You won't feel bad after buying this amazing product just go for it..",5
"After one time use its not charging keep light blinking only even if i plug directly in power plug thn also not working. This not acceptable for Philips brand,",1
"Disclaimer: Rating based on utility of this product for women. My partner purchased this product for himself and I could not help but test this on myself. Big mistake. Epilators also come with trimmer attachment but are harmless if used with wrong alignment/ direction. Whereas this trimmer if used incorrectly will cut your skin. So, women should definitely not use this until and unless they are sure of not making any mistake.",2
"With all the high praise this trimmer has received, and trying my best to get along with it (for a year), it is difficult to be too critical.. The problems I faced: I probably have skin that is ""incompatible"" with electric shavers, or at least this particular make/ model. I had all kinds of rashes, infection, bubbles, boils, pustules and every known skin condition (some unknown too; baffled the wise doctor), other than normal acceptable, presentable, skin of-course. To solve this problem, I had to spend more money to buy lots of lotions, creams, medicines (prescribed by doctors), disinfectants, etc., but nothing has worked. (again, with the high praise this trimmer is recieved) it must be a one-off ""incompatibility"", like trying to install Android apps on an iPhone.. Then the cutter itself (and my beard is ""normal"" (not too thin nor hard - as confirmed by my barber, who is considered an expert in matters of the hair)), did not ""cut"", it tried to pull the hair out of my face.. Oh, and the mess, the bathroom, sink, and clothes all covered with tiny (pulled-out) hair. It is difficult to imagine this is the twenty-first century (felt more like the middle ages).. For me (in the twenty-first century), I've gone back to the DE razor (1880's technology). No fuss, no mess, no skin problems, no expenditure on creams, etc. Added benefit: I'm cleanshaven, which everybody in the office likes; probably get me some promotions too.. I broke open the shaver, and got two good AAA sized batteries that I'm now using in my TV remote. My kid took the motor for something.. UPDATE: Trust me on this, the Mi trimmer is much better, and waterproof too.",1
"I've been using it for about 1 months fully satisfied with the product quality and also Amazon service is as usual best among its competitors.. The main concern is for a Good Battery backup. I use it once a week and it hardly takes 10 min to trim and for that I have to charge only once a month. So no worry for battery even if it gets discharged, it can be operated with cord.. Other features like precision, quality, durability, cleaning detachable parts etc. are not to be worried from a brand like phillips.. Also, there are many other models having several types of blades for complete grooming but choose them as per requirements. For trimming only beards this is best among all brands in this range.. The build quality is good. It doesn't feel cheap when you hold the trimmer. The comb attachment is also convenient.",5
"Dont buy any philips product, got damaged after 5 to 6 month of use and the service center where i repaired in Cuttack,Odisha is not good.. Dont buy any product from Philips.. This is my personal experience",1
"NAMASTE🙏. First of all the built quality of trimmer QT4011/15 is good.The good thing about this trimmer is that it works for a lot of time,just charge for 60 minutes and use it for more than 100 minutes.Blade quality is excellent .It glides very smooth on skin without any irritation.The range of length selection wheel is till 20mm.Also if you register online on the philips website ,you get 1 year extended warranty ,making it a total of 3 years .Thats so much great than what i expected.Also after sales service is fantastic.Adjustable length setting is quite good,but has a small flaw that at lower settings the beard is not cut equally ,you will have to do it more carefully and spend more time if you want a flawless look.. Pros of product-. 👉Battery life is better than other trimmers. 👉Easy to clean as it comes with brush.. 👉Comes with charging indicator to show battery level. 👉Quality of blade is fantastic. 👉Easy to carry comes with carry bag. 👉2 year worldwide warranty+1 year extended warranty .. 👉Sharp blades,even after long use it doesnt loose sharpness. 👉It is very easy to hold as grip of this product is good. Cons of product-. ❌Not completely showerproof.. CONCLUSION-. ●Overall the trimmer is handy,portable, easy to useIt works well,is affordable and definitely performs exceedingly well.Great product for a reasonable price!. ☺Please press helpful button to remind me if my review helps you!THANK YOU.",5
"2000rs for this is a joke. It was 600 3years back. This way the trim length setting is done is useless. Where you put at 1 or 10, trimming will be same. At 10, trimming will even be uneven. Really it is just a 0.5mm trimmer because that is what the actual machine is. Rest it is bad. Bettter buy trimmer with multiple trim blades.",1
"This trimmer is absolute crap. Didn't even last 3 months. I have been using Philips trimmers for 7 years now and was really happy with their product quality and durability. Purchased this trimmer for above 2k in July and it didn't even last till October. The battery stopped charging and it doesn't work anymore. I tried different adapter but it was of no use. Looks like the battery is dead and the trimmer is not picking up charge. It's a shame that a company which used to manufacture top notch trimmers is selling crap these days. My 2k has gone down the drain and even a trimmer worth 500 bucks(Nova) lasts more than this. Really disappointed with Philips. My previous Philips trimmer also didn't last more than 6 months and this was even worse.. Please do not buy. You can easily get other cheaper brands around 1k and they will last much longer. An absolute waste of money, doesn't even feel premium. The new MI trimmer is much better and long lasting than this one.. Update: Reached out to Philips customer service and finally they got it repaired in one month's time. I'm glad that it works again and thanks to Philips for their help. Updating the rating. I'm taking away 2 stars for the trouble I had to go through and 1 months time which they took for the repair.",3
"This trimmer has been with me for past 9-10 months and I have been using very extensively. It is a very very good trimmer with amazing battery life. I just need to charge it once and then it could give you 4-5 shaves without a problem.. One of the bad things about this is that it does not work when you just want to just decrease the height of the beard to 1.5-5 rather than making it 0, as its provided accessory is made out of plastic and it gets bend when you set. So, it gives you a patchy beard where some part are clipped to 2 number some are 2.5 and some are 1.5. it just ruins the whole beard.. I would much rather suggest you to get a trimmer with traditional adjustment accessory. It would be much much better for that case.",1
"Those of who reviewed here high rating for this product, I believe wouldn't have used hassle-free trimmer before.. I usually grow my beard 3-4 Centimeter before i trim it. This device cannot easily cut 3-4cm hair. You will have to keep doing at the same place 9-10 times until it scales down to the desired length. If you decided to use clip, This device is a nightmare. And if you don't use clip, you will get just 0.5 length. Never tried, but hopefully without the clip this device might be working well, That's why i believe all those positive ratings. It took me around 30 minutes to trim. I was using Panasonic ER207WK24B. I had been using for 5-6years. I dropped one then i bought the same again. Even the second one I had dropped. Third time i wanted to go for a change and bought this philips. I really regret. The only drawback in the Panasonic model is charge time and usage time. It would not take more than 5 minutes to trim the beard in the Panasonic model i used.",1
"A great trimmer for the price of Rs.1489. Nice blades and long lasting battery. i have been using it since one and a half year, works fine and haven't faced any problem with it so far. Overall great product.",5
"Have been using it since Jan 2018 and here are the impressions.. Pros:. 1. Good battery life (I use it for 7 ~ 8 times between recharges). 2. reliable \ made to last. 3. excellent for trimming (using the attachment). Cons:. 1. Without attachment, it may cut the skin and leave rashes(+ itching). So extremely close trimming is not advisable. 2. The attachment is not perfect in the way it trims, especially if one want to trim mustache. Need extra effort to get the perfect trim. 3. Trimming long beards would need frequent cleaning as the trimmer blades tend to get stuffed with hair quick. 4. a bit noisier than the german devices I've used in the past. 5. cleaning it is not the easiest, though several other devices are much more complicated. 6. trimmer spacing adjustment may accidentally be twisted, changing settings. So remember which setting you've initially kept",4
good quality and grip almost 2 hours of usage time led light indicator while charging for charged status. respected and trusted brand Philips.. 4* out of 5* because its new and durability is still to judged. so far so good,4
"Phillips is scamming people by saying that it's a corded and cordless trimmer. Even in corded mode(charging), it relies on battery power for operation. It doesn't work at all in corded mode if the battery is low or dead. I was expecting to use it in charging mode after it's battery becomes dead after 2-3 years of use. But it simply doesn't work. Philips is scamming people that it's a corded and cordless trimmer.. So this is completely useless.. I purchased it in September 2017, it's battery became dead in 1 year of low use. It doesn't last more than 2-3 minutes now.",1

There are many products that are there in the market but none can't beat Philips in terms of quality and delivery of performance... This product completely delivers whatever is mentioned in the description.. the titanium blades are very sturdy and usage of the trimmer is also very smooth without any hassles... Major beauty that I liked in this product is that the battery life is tremendous.. I had used many trimmers before but none of them gave me this much performance in terms of battery.. also the indicator on the trimmer for battery is also a pleasant feature for indication and charging accordingly.. also effective fast charging for an hour and delivery for more hours is one of the major advantages that you should consider buying this... You can just close your eyes and buy this product without a second doubt...,5
"I bought this trimmer after a lot of research. It was the best I could get. I was happy with it. But, it stopped working within a year. And now it's completely useless. What's the point of buying such an expensive trimmer when I could have bought another for less than 1/4th of the price of this trimmer? The product could not match its brand name.",1
The plastic length adjuster really need some quality improvements.. Breaks quite often in an year time and getting a replacement also very tough. (only through the Philips service centers).. Outside it is up to 5 times expensive (online shops),4
My humble advice is not to purchase this product.. It is making too much sound also trimming is not proper. I am using Panasonic since last 5 years which is still better than this philips new one.,1
Nice product,4
"It is my 1st trimmer. Got this just day before in sale at 1699, after going through the reviews. On flipkart, it has been purchased by more than 1,30,000 people, out of which only 6000-7000 people were complaining. Most of them were about delicate parts being broken, and packaging. However, now after using it I can say that one has to take a bit of care about electronic products. you can't expect steel parts everywhere, as insulation has to be kept in mind. Even though I think that packaging could've been better (it's a small box, with things cramped in), it's not that big deal to give very less ratings.....I have deducted 1 star for that. I have used it once, and must say it feels very handy, light, and easy to use. Btw you get a charger, brush and pouch in the box along with warranty card and user manual.",4
"Although the Packaging upon opening might disappoint you as there is no big Philips trimmer box that you might have expected but Amazon is selling the product in small recycled packages as the Modern man is not only conscious about the looks but the environment as well, which certainly brings a smile upon your face.. The Product takes approximately 1 hour to charge fully cuz you spent a lot of money for an old age best philips trimmer available.. Product gives you the look you desire with no heating issues or uneasiness while trimming.. From Philips this is the best they have to offer you for now, if you have trust in Philips it's gurantee, go for it and save environment too with Amazon!!. #1699 #GreatIndianSale2k18",5
The device is easy to use however it is not good if you have soft skin or soft beard. It is very easy to cut the skin and since the attachment comb guard is curved the hair gets pushed down instead of being upwards as it was in the previous models. They don’t even provide an alternative comb to purchase.. The good features are its light weight and ability to be used while the charging wire is plugged in.,1
"Previously I thought it is because of my hand movement that I'm getting several cuts on my face. I used my friend's trimmer (same product, same model) and it's working without any harm to my skin.. Now it is confirmed that it is a serious issue of defective blade head / defective sliding blade. Never expected such a product form Amazon. Very anxious on me that I doubted myself during replacement/return period rather than doubting the product.",1
I strongly recommend to buy some MI trimmer instead unless you want to change it after 2 years. This is relatively expensive and have only one comb. Battery recharge-life was fine but after 2 years it dies. By that time either you will not find replacement batteries or it will cost almost 50% of the trimmer cost and 70% of what new MI would cost. A battery that die in couple of years is poor quality. Replacing gadgets is bad for our planet. So stay away from Philips is my recommendation.,2
"This is a good beard trimmer. However, I do not expect the plastic comb to survive for long and this apprehension is based on the experience of using a Philips grooming kit for over 6 years now. The grooming kit had three different combs and all of them broke, one by one and I had to discard the grooming kit as the combs were no more available with Philips. I would suggest ordering an extra comb with the trimmer.. Functionally, the trimmer is well powered for its task and the battery lasts as per the specified time in the manual. The biggest advantage with this trimmer is the one hour charging time and its capability to work while being charged. The trimmers struggles a bit while trimming a thick beard as the hair gets stuck under the blade and obstructs the blade movement. Works perfectly well for thin beards.",4
"This is a great product. Easily one of the best in the market. The build quality and battery charing speed, backup is exceptional.. I am not gonna go into detail here as there are thousand of reviews availible just in the same column. One thing i am gonna say is that its price fluctuates every 2 to 3 days. Mostly it is 1999 but if you hold your excitement and wait just a little(2 days) , you will randomly see it's price has dropped to 1699.. PEACE OUT.",5
"I have used it to trim off my head hair and beard, the results is great.. The things I liked. 1) Precision. 2) Battery life in one full charge. 3) Easy to use and clean. 4) Design. 5) 1yr extended warranty on registering the product in philips website.. Using it without comb, u will feel a little warm as the naked cutter touch ur face for clean shave. However a clean shave looked like u have shaved a day before. It can also be used for cutting body hair but careful for using it on private parts... The naked cutter doesn't cut or scratch the skin even if u r using it casually.. Highlights of it's uses - Beard, moustache, head hair, body hair, under arm hair.",5
"I ordered this product, and it had stopped charging itself after the first charge, and i cannot reach the customer care, and i have been given a faulty product, i believe. If someone at amazon/phillips is listening/reading to this. You should not send faulty products to your customers. The product is still in the warranty period and there is still no response from the amazon/phillips side.",1
"This was my first Philips grooming product and I am totally floored by this product. I am writing this review after 5 years and I am still using the product and it still works like a charm. Tells you a lot about the quality of the product. I have not had to spend even a single penny on it, neither have I ever taken it to customer center. Its build quality is amazing and the quality of blades is excellent. It is still very sharp and my beard rarely gets stuck. The battery backup is quite good. Initially it used to give around 90 minutes after full charge but now it has fallen down to 50-60 minutes which is amazing given it has been 5 years since I purchased this. It takes around 8 hours to charge it completely. Plus the extended warranty of 2 years meaning a total of 3 years warranty. It was too good a deal to miss.. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to buy a quality trimmer under 1500 bucks.",5
"I bought this in Oct 2015. Initially I did not understand how to use it. But after few trial and errors, I understood how to use it... 1. Its been close to 4 years and it works amazing... 2.Just an hour of charging while you are doing some other work and it keeps going on and on... Battery life is FANTASTIC.. 3. Ease of use. What you need to know if you are new to trimming, is watch few videos in Youtube and once get it you would love it.. Cons:. 1. only 1 attachment .. its fragile.. but i used it carefully and its as good as new.. but if there are larger combs available atleast at additional price it would be great!",5
Product is excellent but box is totally changed from Amazon image and market product you will confuse that product is original or duplicate product performance is excellent for small beard product is also small but comfortable. Battery backup is too good for use please buy only this for good performance with good battery backup,3
"I received a used and broken product. There was hair on the plastic brush, which came broken when the box was opened.. The length wheel was dirty, the body had signs of wear and tear. Printed info on the back was worn out as well. I have initiated a return process, hope I can buy a better trimmer before the sale ends.",1
"I am return this trimmer because duplicate trimmer send i complement Amazon coustomer service. I purchase this trimmer Flipkart and original product. Amazon is also good products and my first chose purchase any products but this time my first bad experience. Flipkart good products but am many book return because books pages and covers damage. So this two shopping sites good products rang and also delivered good packaging, products and services but minimum sellers bad products sell customers and customer trust break and next online shopping product he don't trust and he share his experience friend and other platform. So i request amazon he check sellers product quality regularly and fraud seller block acount. Thank you",1
"I was advised this product by my friend. I did almost 3 months of market research to figure out, which would be the best trimmer for a novice. Well, I found it pretty helpful because.. 1. Quick charging system. 2. edges are rounded, so it wont hurt the skin. 3. Light weight and handy. 4. Blades are really sharp, so does it trick pretty quick.. The only recommendation, I would give to other novices is, please donot press it against your skin, as you may not get the desired size of the beard/moustache. It needs to be left soft on your skin once you have adjusted the size. Rest all good!",5
"1-20 lock-in length settings-You can either trim your beard to zero or maintain it heavy.. 2-Blades stay extra-sharp to always cut hairs neatly and effectively, but have rounded bladetips and combs to prevent irritation.. 3-Titanium blades are known for superior cutting performance and long-lasting sharpness and it has those with impeccable sharpness.. 4-Ergonomic design-It's very sleek and light so you can easily trim your beard without loosing the grip.. 5-I am using it since 6 months and i haven't faced any issue so far regarding blades or anything else.. 6-""You'll have 90 minutes of cordless power after 1 hour of charging""- this is what company says and guess what it goes above their statements,i charge it once in a week and it lasts 4-5 days to be really frank, so battery back up is really really good.. 7-So this product stands unique in the market in it's segment, just love it, GO FOR IT.. 7-",5
"Purchased Aug 2017, Died Sep 2019; lasted exactly 2 years. The use of the trimmer was about once or twice a week, sometimes less but never more. I would remove the blade and clean it and the end of the trimmer from the inside, with some water under the tap. I may have done some wrong because it looks like the motor has died, the battery seems fine.. Anyway, it's a decent trimmer for the price. Last about two years or more if you're more careful than I was. Cheers!",4
"This is one the better trimmers available in the market,. It offers great precision up to 0.5 mm & a lot of variable length options according to your desire.. It comes with a carrying pouch which is handy as it keeps it clean & also a cleaning brush,. It also comes with a charging adapter which you won't need much as it charges to full in about 1hr & gives roughly 2hrs of usage which is great.. It comes titanium blades which has a self sharpening technology which i'm not really sure of & can't say it'll help the blades longer, though the blades themselves are of very high quality as you get a very precise trim.",5
"Writing a review after 2yrs & 6mos, I have used it for quiet sometime now.. It will work like a charm for the first few months, easy to hold and good amount of length adjustments.. However the downside is the desired accuracy for trimming is not something that this one offers and also maintenance. Cleaning the blade with dry brush is absolutely necessary everytime after use otherwise the life of blade will reduce and need to replace the blade, I have replaced the blade once and have not found the trimmer to be the same. To sum up the life of the trimmer is about 2 years after which you need to buy a new trimmer as replacement blades(even original) don't work like the original!",3
Pros:. Multiple levels for deciding length of the hair. Precise function. Shar blades. Good quality. Handy and easy to use. Good battery back up and quick charging. Cons :. Cleaning is little complicated.. Dunno if I wasn't able to but for haircut might not be the best option.. Caused very minor rashes on skin (most trimmers do more than this but even this one caused minor rashes). U will be back to normal in a day.. Other. I ordered in 2020 and got a product manufactured in 2017. No complaint with the product or functionality but still not happy for this. Even the manual had turned yellow like those old papers.,4
"This was not bought for the purpose it was built i.e. beard trimming. Am using it for haircut for myself and son. Both of us used it once and pretty happy with the investment. During this pandemic, going to a barber didn't seem like an option. After some Youtube research, this trimmer did a good job with helping me with crew cuts.. The product feels sturdy and has good quality finish - this is my first trimmer, so don't have a frame of reference to compare. With full charge, it worked for 45 mins easily. One may need to get used to the settings - the number 2.5 itself seemed like super short. Maybe it will work well when used for a beard.",5
"I had purchased the QG3387 multi-groom model 2 yrs back whose blade is much smoother. Never did I get a rash or cuts. But this one, even after getting a replacement, I'm just not satisfied with the blade - it's too sharp. It's fine for the beard (although there's redness) but I've got cuts in the underarm area twice. Philips quality has suffered with lower prices items available nowadays.. The only advantage of this model is it's fast charging & using it while charging.",3
"After buying 3-4 trimmers from Philips I landed on this model, soon I realized my previous purchases were junk. Because of one primary reason:. They all were dead when I most needed them and can't be used in corded mode. Had to charge them for at least 4 hours to use them properly.. But with this model, there is no such tension. I can use it in a corded mode which is very helpful.. Secondly, it takes at most an hour to charge compared to the older model. Frequency of my charging is 30min/6-8 Trims. Coming to Titanium blade, didn't noticed much difference as my other Philips models do the same good job. But it does look good and shiny!. If you don't want to rely on battery I would strongly recommend this product because of its good battery life and corded use option.",5
"I have been using it for the past 6 months and below are my views.. 1. The battery is very good and it lasts for 2-3 hours atleast.. 2. The blades are really good and i get a very good trim for beard.. 3. Quite easy to clean but sometimes the hairs get struct more inside.. 4. It takes few hours to get it fully charged and there is no option to use to while charging.. 5. Handy and lightweight, easy to carry as well.. overall it is a very good one and i am very much comfortable.",4
"Works fine, but build quality is underwhelming. Also quite small and vibrations while using are bothersome. But get the job done just fine, with rounded blades that pretty skin friendly. Feels overpriced.. Also, the product wasn't delivered in original packaging, rather a smaller cardboard box. Plus certain packaging stuff were missing like plastic sticker between blades. I suspect this is refurbished or warranty defect peice resold in sale... Can't verify currently but if this is true then its really shady business!",3
"1.plastics and built quality are not good, mounting of plastic also bad and there are silly sounds in all mounted area. 2.fast is ok but the same time very loud and vibrating makes irritating trimming experience. 3. on package and plastic used and it mound raises doubt on genuineness of the product. 4. irrespective of no. of good reviews there are above problem and etc.. good review comes it way due to inexperienced user of the product",3
"Product is extremely decent. If you have used something better - like Wahls clippers - then you would know that this one isn't powerful at all. It's good for the beard a few other places because those places don't require a strong motor.. The people praising this to the heavens have clearly not used a higher quality clipper.. My first initial impression of this item was: quite small. Then I turned it on and was not impressed. I used it and was not impressed. It's a decent item. I cannot even call it a ""good"" item. It will help you in trimming your hair. But this isn't a high quality trimmer by any means. I am glad I tried this one because it means that any Philips and other cordless trimmers will most likely be weak and should be avoided.. I will stick with andis or wahl clippers from here on.. All in all, this item does the job but isn't very strong.",2
"I have been using this trimmer for more than 6 months now. Battery backup is excellent as promised and it is very easy to clean. No overnight charging required. Even if the battery is drained out completely, just 10 min of charging can get the job done when needed. I use it once or twice a week and last charged 2 months ago. Based on my previous experience with trimmers, it is worth spending extra money for its quick charging compared to ones that take several hours just for a single use.",5
"I dislike the comb design completely. It's absolutely useless. Whether you put it in 3mm, 5mm, or whatever, it's just the same. Better to use it without the comb. I had an old version of this same trimmer, and I really wished Philips would've changed the design over the past several years. But nope, they chose to stick to their ridiculously stupid comb design. The trimmer on its own is superb, and that's why the 4 stars I've given. So if you want a precisely cut 5mm beard, better go for other brands. But for a clean trim, I'd definitely suggest this trimmer.",4
Stopped working in 10 months after use. I occasionally use trimmer and I dont even over charge. But still it stopped working suddenly. I went with brand name but Philip's cheated me with thier poor quality. I dont trust this brand anymore. Since its second trimmee from Phillip's both stopped working after few months. I initially thought that earlier model had some issue but this model is little costly but still the result is same. Both stopped working in few months.,1
"I like this one because it does what it says, very good for beard trimming. But not that good for hair clipping (Even though I got a pretty decent hair cut using this one), I would have chosen something stronger. But for beard trimming, it works perfect. Still shape enough after 3 years of use.. And you can use it even while charging.",5
"This may not be a perfect trimmer, the cut is not to the bottom, it will remain the hair and you can feel half way trimmed. and it also leave scratches on your skin when you touch the corners. Corners should not be sharp(should be rounded), i bought for my dad as he could not shave due to Perkinson/elderly aging effects. I have to trim myself for him, he could not able to do as the corners leaving the marks and irritations are there for three days.",3
"This review is after year-long use of Philips Trimmer QT4011/15. (Use: Two to three times a week). Pros:. 1. Excellent battery life. Lithium-ion battery gives quick recharge and longer battery life. Observed better stand-by time as well.. 2. Excellent Razers quality and still has its sharpness after year.. 3. Good Handling. 4. 8 level settings.. Cons:. Only Con that I found is it's design for length adjuster. Design is not like regular flat trimmer. Slight change in pressure changes its length due to its spring design, so Length adjust feature is of no use.",3
"This is one of the best beard trimmers one can get.. The cuts are precise and the trimming is also good. The best part of this trimmer is the battery life. I literally charged this fully once and was able to use this for 6-8 times for normal beard shaping and trimming the whole beard once. The design helps trimming the beard and can also bring sharpness. Comes with good warranty. The charging light indicator is also handy and helps to know when to remove from charging. Cleaning this is bit of a difficult task, but with the quality it brings with it I can bear this.",5
Wanted to return but return not applicable. Product is no where close to its specifications for usage and quality. Disappointed.,2
"I have been using this trimmer for 2 years, recently recommended it to my brother and he bought it as well.. A class product for this price range, yes there are many other Philips trimmer too but this one has good battery life, it lasts to use 5-6 times with single charge. I like the blade quality as well. Its a wonderful product from Philips. Additionally, you can extend warranty by signing up on Philips website.",5
There are so many varieties available - but since the last one lasted almost 5 years I went for the same trimmer again. The previous one's head started having some issue - the motor runs fine but the blades won't move. Rest all is well with it...,5
"Bought it for ₹1699/- Fast and safe Delivery of product.. About product: All is good except.... 1. Blades are sharp, gives slight cuts without safety comb if not properly used near neck area.. 2. I prefer the previous multigroom one I had because of Turbo mode, and better rounded blade that won’t cut Over this one. But this one is okey for the cost.",4
"Good tool, PATHETIC battery.. The trimmer has good performance, is very reliable, easy to clean.. The rechargeable battery STOPS FUNCTIONING within a year! Making it not cordless anymore.. Because of this, I have to plug in an extension board, drag it all the way up to the mirror, and then plug in the trimmer to its charger, plug the charger onto the extension board, and then use the trimmer!. No, this isn't a one-off thing. This is my second time buying this very same trimmer. What was the issue with the first one ? The same thing - battery stops recharging!. And so, I'm done with this trimmer from Philips. It's a good trimmer, except that its battery stops charging within 1 year.",2
"The product is really best! I wanted to buy a trimmer for head hair but got left with beard trimmers only. Picked it up after long search and comparison between many products. from my own experience, it can be used for head haircut. You yourself can trim hair from front side of head and need other person to cut it from rear side.. The trimmer is sharp. the hair gets clogged at the length adjuster but that's not machine fault. It is made for Beard not for voluminous hair but with frequent cleaning it can be used well.. I am very much satisfied with the purchase!",5
"the built quality of trimmer is good. Blade quality also very good. Remember Its trimmer not shaver. It trims chest, underarm , even on pubic hair. but I don't recommend to use it on the balls. Only one problem i find that is. Its plastic comb for adjusting the length of beard is not so good quality. you have to use the comb very carefully its very delicate.",5
"I have been using Philips trimmer for years now. This one is very poor in quality compared to earlier ones. My last philips trimmer, after 1.5-2 years use, would last for 2 trims when fully charged (on full grown beard I trim twice a week at 0 setting). For similar use this has been disappointing. It started giving very poor battery performance in only 3-4 months. For the first 3 months it was fine i.e. I would be able to use it for at least 4 trims without charging. After 3 months one fine day in my second use after full charge it died. Since then it lasts only 1 or max 1.5 trim when fully charged. Seriously disappointing!",2
"Philips trimmer. I have been using this trimmer for over one year . I will not waste your time and simply say that this product is totally worth it . Here are the reasons why-. 1) Battery life - Even after using this trimmer for so long , the battery life only deteriorated slightly. Unlike most trimmers in the market, it has a consistent battery life of around 1 hour of cordless use after charging it fully. If you couldn't charge the battery , you can easily use it with the long and convenient power cord plugged in.. 2) Ergonomics and ease of use- The trimmer has a shape which is made specially for trimming the facial hair with ease. The titanium blades are sharp and do the job quite quickly. Use it for the rest of your body but be careful in sensitive areas like your armpit since it is quick and sharp and can nick those regions . The extra clip and the adjustable length rotor is a great feature , but be mindful when picking a length that doesn't over trim your hair.. It is easy to clean with the little brush provided in the box, since the blade head is detachable .. 3) Brand value - Philips is known to offer consumers with great value and quality products which are long lasting. This is just one of the Philips products I have reviewed and it is great. I would highly recommend everyone to register their products on the official site and get additional warranty.. If this trimmer is not available you can go for any other trimmer from the same brand which suits your needs and it wont disappoint you .. Thank you. Leave a thumbs up if you liked the detailed review !",5
"Very helpful . I started using it to trim my husband's hair. Very hesitant in the beginning to use this but the first time itself I got confidence using it. Very easy to handle. It is worth the money. Now my husband will not go to salon anymore, as I became a super hair stylist 💇‍♂️ . If a beginner like me can do then anyone can do. Just go for it.",5
"though this trimmer lacks on accessories, it truly compensates with performance, very good battery life and fast charging time like an hour or so to fully charge and 'it lasts' for real. my suggestion a must buy product for men if they aren't using one. if we could get more accessories with it, this would be one of the best trimmers available at this price point.",5
"I have used many trimmers but this one is the best among all. The best thing is the battery. Charge it for just 60 mins and and use it for more than 100 mins which is a big deal. Ot is very smooth over the skin. And cleaning is also very easy, they have provided the brush which cleans the trimmer with no hurdle.. It could be a bit expensive but just go for it. You purchase it once and forget about buying the trimmer again for very long. The customer care service of Philips is well known.",5
Packaging was good and protective.. Posting this after 4 years of uses.. The only one reason to buy this is its battery backup.you can use this for 90 minutes after charging of 60 minutes.you can also use this while charging so why Phillips gives a very long charging cable with this.. Blades are made out of brass which is good and the sharpness is still good while i am using this from last 4 years.. The battery is still working properly and the motor is also strong.. I bought it in sale so it worth buying it.,5
I've been using this product since 5 months and I have to say I'm fully satisfied. The battery life is excellent even if charged for less 40 min. Titanium blades are sharp. The numbering and grip everything is great including the in-hand feel. This is my second trimmer from Philips but my previous model is different though. Really Philips is a brand to trust.,5
I am writing this review on 17 August 2020 with almost 6 month of usage . Its kind a worth for money i bought it for rupees 1799 if you are getting in this price then its worthy. It takes 1 hour to full charge and can be used over one hour continuously and also be used if the charger is plugged in. You receive a separate charger with the product and also a small pouch which makes it easy to store.,5
"I am writing this review after using it for over 5 times. Few things that you should take a note of before purchasing this product:. 1. The wheel to adjust the length of the blade it's not at all smooth. 2. Having just one clipper, depending on the wheel to adjust the legth is a little bummer. It does not do a great job in ensuring a smooth trim. 3. If you are going in for a zero length, you have to remove the clipper, which makes sense. However, the zero length is not a smooth experience you would expect when have such a reputed brand at helm. Specially, at the chin area, it gets very rough and difficult to apply any pressure. 4. For the price (Rs.2000) this is not a purchase I would recommend to anyone.. 5. The only saving grace is the charging and battery life. If you have ran out of battery and have like 10 mins at your hand, that charge will allow you to trim at ease.",3
"Best trimmer, I have been using it from last 5 years, but didn't see any fault.. Nice battery 🔋.. Time to fully charge is 2 hours.. I normally use it in every 15-20 days to trim my beards and after full charge I can use it for 2-3 months I.e. 4-5 times.. There is an indicator as well if battery gets low.. You can even use it while charging.. After 5 years, the battery is really good, only thing is you need to take care of this trimmer.. Don't charge it for more than 2 hours, otherwise it will affect its battery life.. There are 20 precision settings to trim for different hair length.. Blades are also brilliant. So overall amazing.. I would like to give more than 5 star rating to this trimmer but unfortunately I can't.",5
The product is very easy to use. Can work on the inbuilt battery plus can work while charging those batteries from the adapter provided. Charging cable is long enough. Cleaning is also simple but need to tap unit sometimes to get rid of small hair stuck in the groves. Cleaning brush provided is useful in cleaning the inside of the blade after removing it from the assembly,5
"I previously had a philips trimmer which became blunt after 2years and charge didn't last very long, also took 8-10hours to charge fully. This one charges up real quick, when in a hurry a 10 15min charge can do a trimming for me. Titanium blades are sharp hope they don't become blunt very soon. The thing I don't like personally is that it's still uses a proprietary charger, there's no USB charging like some other trimmers have.",5
After using second time it work fine when i tried to use for third time the battery charge is no more and i charge for 1 hour and battery charge not last for 5 minutes ... I am looking to replace it but replacement policy is no more...I didn't belive that even philips product also worse...,1
"I had ordered one a couple of years back from Amazon, and was completely satisfied with it. When my son wanted one, I had no hesitation picking this up again. It’s got a great battery life, extremely quick charging, great grip, and the trim is great too.. It’s actually a no brainier picking this one up over everything else.",5
"The product has stopped working after 1.5 months of usage(Hardly 3 to 4 times). it is showing Green when connected to charger but after removing charger, i am not able to switch on it.. i brought the same product few years back and worked well.. It looks like Amazon is duping all duplicate/Fault Philips trimmers into the Online.",1
"Battery life is awesome, product quality awesome, price quite high but bought it at reasonable price a year ago and comes with 3 years of warranty so not a problem. I also recommend to reader please buy amazon fulfilled products only and do check manufacture warranty. Also do check whether the brand service centre is present near your location or not.",4
"its so confortable.. battery is good gicing ne abou 6 shaves in one recharge... u can use it while it is charging, it is most useful option in it. But it doesn't give u complete shave look... as its blades are safe, it diesnt give close shave feeling but it is fine... coming to private parts shaving it is not recommended as the sensitive skin gets cut...",5
The product is working fine.. You should buy it because it can be fully charged with in an hour.. Other trimmers take almost 12 hours to get fully charged.. Everything is good.. But After 2 years there is some problem on battery backup now.. I have talked to the philips service center regarding this but instead of changing the battery they have given me new charger.. But the issue remains still.. I can expect this issue from any electronic item but philips service center should solve it.. But product is really good.,5
"product is good, nice battery backup and fast charging. The reason of 2 star is i got cheated, outer courier package was fine but inside item box seal was broken and inside the box of QT401, they put another less priced used philips trimmer.. However, after complaint and return option i got the new correct one but still there is no apology call or any feedback from them.. So you can order it but check properly when receive specially from cloudtail retailer, you can read many such story in this forum about them and now i know its true.",2
"superb battery backup. Once charged for 1-1.5 hours, lasts for around 90 minutes which is sufficient for 5-6 times of trimming. Waited for offer for a long time but no luck so purchased in regular offer.. Past experience: Philips trimmers are durable as earlier i have used qt4019( exactly same features) which i bought 7 years back which still works great with cord but very weak battery backup.",5
"I saw many positive reviews and thought of buying it, but to my surprise it did not do well. I've other philips model which is way better than this one.. Trimmer's cross plates gets hot during trimming and may harm your skin. This trimmer has multiple levels of trimming size, I used zero level but still trimming was not perfect. I would suggest to go for Philips grooming kit instead of this model.",3
As we all know about the brand...Philips serves the best quality.. The build quality of this trimmer is really good and also the quality of charging cable as well as the charging speed is decent and can be used easily for more than 1 hour.. The different lengths of the comb is also very suitable and managed according to the requirement.. One of the best trimmer in this price.,5
Saviour in my these extraordinary COVID-19 times. Setting at 6 works for me. It has good backup and frankly I have charged only once and I got two trimmings out of it and I think it still got plenty to juice left in it. Not water proof. Use bundled brush to clean the innards of machine and wash blades under running water.,5
"Loved the trimmer. I brought it as an update for my old Philips trimmer. It surely impressed me with its performance. A single charge itself is lasting for few times. And, also the time it's taking to get full charge is very less which makes it a best option for travel or urgent needs either.. Also, because of the Amazon great India festival, I bought it for a price lesser than the usual which adds up to the happiness from using it.",5
"Product worked fine for about a year.. Then problems started to come in and in stopped working one day.. But that's not the worst part.. Worst part began when I deposited my trimmer in phillips service centre in Agra.. It has been a month since then they have not repaired my trimmer. Whenever I call them, they usually don't pick it or say that they will call in 5 minutes. It felt that I have been looted by phillips. While buying a product usually warranty is a point one considers. But when it comes to my experience with phillips, you better don't go for thier warranty as you will only be harrased by pathetic customer service.",1
This is my 3rd trimmer from Philips in the past 15 years. And all was good. I had a similar Q series earlier and only reason for purchasing this is the charger issue I had earlier.. This new model is way ahead and has titanium blades. It's very fast in operation. Battery charge is too fast and batter life is too good. Go for it.,4
Excellent! I tried many cheap trimmers but they were all waste. Philips costed more than other cheap local trimmers but quality is amazing. Very helpful in this pandemic situation where we avoid barbers. I have a thick beard and can be used for near clean shave at 1 point trimmer. Can be used to trim other body parts as well other than genital/pubic area. Very happy with this product. Regret not purchasing it earlier. Just go for it!!,5
"I hope bought this the 2nd time. Last time I bought this trimmer was in 2016. It lasted good 3 years, the it started giving me battery troubles. I use it weekly so you can do the math. Even without the charge you can use it plug n play mode.. One call out.. There is 10 adjustments, it's incorrectly mentioned as 20 adjustment.",4
"I have become a permanent customer of Philips in case of trimmers. The previous one I used was another model which costed around 1000 bucks 3 years ago and I have no complaints yet. Even in this product, the blade does not loose it's edge for years. The motor works perfectly fine. I must appreciate the battery considering that it is running a motor. Damm, the product is durable. Yes, the cord is not tight and detaches sometimes while using it, but that is not a concern when u r using a cordless one. Yes, this is worth spending more than the previous one as its blade is clearly better. And after all a 1000 bucks more doesn't matter when u r getting a product which lasts for years.",5
"To be honest this is the best trimmer made by philips. I only purchase philips trimmers because of the ease and simplicity they provide yet they are most effective. In this product I really like the colour combination of red and black plus it's very handy, nice grip, and easy to use, makes it the ideal trimmer for anyone. The trimmer can be used for facial hairs , beard as well as body hairs also, yes it works very well down there very convenient to use and easily handleable. I am so happy with my decision that I bought this product. the biggest advantage of Philips trimmer is that you can charged for an hour and use it for approx 90 minutes which is so good. Titanium blades have such a great quality and it does not cause any irritation on the skin so no worries. I highly recommend this product",5
"I am using this trimmer since 4 years now and still I have never faced an issue with it.. The product runs smooth except the lowered battery life. This is a perfect value for money product and also the best in this price range.. The adjustments are perfect, the blades are really powerful and talking about the battery life, I personally charge it once in every 10 trims. So, I think its pretty fine.. It has a revolving adjuster for varying numbers of trimming.. It is a must buy product if you are looking for a budget trimmer in this price range.",4
"Used for more than four years now and very happy with the product. Battery is still good, only issue is that it doesn't start when the battery is below 60-70% but the workaround is to connect the charger and start on direct power and once started, disconnect the charger and the trimmer still runs with the available charge. I won't say this as a problem as this arises only after four years of usage.",5
"Waste of money.. The trimmer keeps on running.. Unless the battery drain out.. Even with the balde guard, you have to be careful. It cuts your skin. Cleaning this trimmer is a mess.",1
"The make and build are very loose and it came out very quickly. For a costly product like this the product is very inferior and does't last long. Mine broke down within 1st use and before a month. Since I left away for a week, I only found out it was not working next time I tried to use it. The return date on amazon has passed unfortunately.",1
"All good, Brand, Seller and Amazon!!. My friend actually made me understand the differences between similar looking models of this. it really takes that quick charge and give s you for a complete trim and even more for a half an hour charge. no need to charge for 8 hours and so. 1 hour is more than enough. price is also not bad, but still, a 300/500 less would make it great is what I feel! of all good one to go :)",5
"Good trimmer. Use it for maintaing beard neck line and general beard trimming. Works fine. Although the length settings are short for longer beards. Cleaning is also fine, the attachment comes of easily. Battery is also fine, does its job.. For long beard maintenance i'd suggest a trimmer with better attachments.",4
"I had full beard and it is hard even after a few days. So, I hesitated going for trimmer. I had used trimmers in my early days of beard, back then my beard is soft and not full. So, it worked flawlessly. In between, I shifted to regular blades and also my beard has thickened.. Even though my brother and cousin are using trimmers, I hesitated going for it and I regret it now.. This trimmer works perfectly even for full & hard beards, also cleaning is super easy. The super most important thing is it’s battery backup. I am charging it once and using for at least 5 times before charging again.",5
"Simple, easy to use trimmer. There aren't too many functions or buttons to confuse the user. It does only one thing and does it very well. I use it on my head and face. The battery life is excellent. I hope the trimmer lasts a long time. The cleaning is a bit tedious, but that is true for almost every trimmer.",5
Used it three times. Trimming was good. Battery backup is good. Can shave while connected to power plug. Easy to clean. Build quality is good and it doesn’t look like a cheap one. It’s a good buy.,5
"This product details mentioned are correct i really get. 1. Long Lasting Performance. Dura power technology optimizes the power consumption to ensure that your trimmer lasts longer.. 2.Corded and Cordless Use. Use it cordless or plugged in. You will have 60 minutes of cordless power after 1 hour of charging.. 3.Skin-Friendly Performance. Blades stay extra-sharp to always cut hairs neatly and effectively, but have rounded blade tips and combs to prevent irritation.. 4.Effortless Trimming with the Zoom Wheel. Easy to use with 20 different length settings - get a 3-day shadow look or a full beard. Simply turn the wheel to select and lock-in the length settings you want or remove the comb and get the zero trim look.. 5.Self-Sharpening Titanium Blades. Advanced titanium blades for superior cutting performance and long-lasting sharpness.. 6.Battery Light. Battery light is green when full, blinks orange when low and blinks green when charging.",5
"It's a review I am writing after 5 years of usage. After 5 years, It seems its battery is now dying slowly, However I can still use it corded, and it works perfectly well. In my overall use of it, I just once had a small problem with its machinery which was fixed on calling Philips Customer service. They did the fix at my door which is why I decided to buy my next trimmer from them. The trimmer did its job perfectly well, however I fell its components were not of very good quality. But, It was value for money deal.",4
"After using Philips QT4011/15 trimmer for almost 1 year here i am reviewing this trimmer. In box you get Trimmer with Comb, Charger, Pouch , Warranty and Manuals.. First of all build quality is excellent . Handling it and using it not an issue. You can easily trim around chin and below jaw line .. Its motor is silent, make normal vibration and noise . Titanium blade are very sharp , but still not single cut on face no matter how rough and fast I trim. Easy to adjust comb. With comb you can trim up to 0.5 mm. You can also use it without comb but you can get cut on face so i would not recommended it . Easy to remove blade and clean .. Now the best and important thing i want to tell is its battery backup. Honestly i am shocked by its backup. I am college student so i use it almost 3-4 times week . It get charged in less than 60 min and last for more than week considering each time i use it for 10-15 min( At the end i will tell some tip to increase your maintain battery backup.) With battery indicator you get to know the status of battery. It comes with small cleaning brush which is not so good but enough for cleaning blades and comb. You get one pouch which make it easy to carry while travelling .. In short. pros of this trimmer. 1)Build quality is good.. 2)Titanium blade are very sharp .. 3)Easy to handle. No cuts while using it.. 4)Battery backup is awesome.. 5)Battery indicator works perfect.. 5)Get Charged fast.. cons-. 1)No waterproof. This is the only problem i find it .. For better battery backup don't charge it full for like 60 min , charge it. So overall you will not regret it buying this trimmer .. I had used those Rs 300-1000 cheap quality trimmers , then I decided to go for some better trimmer. So i know This trimmer definitely worth it's price. I get this trimmer at price of Rs 1899.",5
When I ordered I got used product but thanks to Amazon for fast delivery and replaced my product. 2nd product I got is good one and genuine with no any issue till .Nice trimmer with durable battery backup. Price is little bit high but the trimmer is good.. Pros. 1. Sharp titanium blade.. 2. Battery backup is good. 3. Fast charging.. Cons. 1. Little bit noisy.. 2. Only good for beards not good for hair.. Thanks to Amazon for being a trusted site and for fast delivery service 👍,4
"ordered this on 6th sept got it in 3 days thanks amazon for that.. now this trimmer is amazing actually this is my first trimmer and it just trims perfectly, i love it. every thing is great about this product. just go for it no need to decide. i actually researched for my first trimmer and all that lead to this.. only one con that i can say for this price range they should have made it waterproof.",5
This is truly the best trimmer I've EVER purchased... the price is absolutely unbeatable... I have bought MANY trimmers over the years (and most of them have been all-in-one kits) and they've varied in performance... I mainly use the trimmer for buzzing my head and face/neck down to 1 mm or so... but I imagine this product will last many years if properly maintained from the get-go... a true winner,5
"As the heading says, yes it is. I don't know whether the blade is actually titanium or not but it does give a smooth trim.. Just treat it with care and it will work fine, like charging properly in time and cleaning the blades.. Note: You should only wash the blade(after taking it off) and nothing else. Use the brush to wipe it clean. The red plastic cap is moderrately fragile so be careful with it.",4
"I just love it. Superb product.. I am now using this trimmer since past 15 Months, and no problem what so ever.. I have charged it once and went out of town with the charger and to my surprise the charging lasted till 1 month, (Frequency of use, every alternate days, 5-7 mins). I would highly recommend it as one of the best trimmers,. Just one thing that I didnt like and have give 4 star, that it heats up after continuously on trimmer for 3-4 mins.. other wise an Engineering achievement.",4
"Writing this review after 1 month of usage.. I purchased this trimmer after reading so many positive reviews. But I am disappointed by its performance. Though it has a good battery life, but it gives you uneven performance. It also gets heated quickly and after 10 mins you can't even touch the bled to your face.. This was so unexpected from a premium brand like Philips.. So don't buy it for the brand name or on the basis of positive reviews on Amazon.",3
Got it last diwali and have been using it ever since. First up battery life is amazing. I have maybe charged it 3-4 times since the purchase and that is awesome. Does what it should do but the issue with this is the plastic used for adjusting the size. It is not at all durable and is not even that much effective. I mean it trims unevenly for some reason at times! Also the packaging it comes is way too cheap for the price you pay. Yes it is for eco friendly reason and is mentioned on the box but atleast durable? Was expecting better from Philips.,3
"Let me tell you by my personal experience, it's a great trimmer. I have using it since last one year and I'm really satisfied with my purchase.. There are couple of good things about this one which makes it perfect:. 1 battery backup and charging speed : the battery of this trimmer is really great. With a single charge I can trim my beard 10 times easily and the charging speed is also good. It takes around 1.5 hrs to completely charge it.. 2 quality of the blade and durability: the quality of the blade used in this one is really high. It always gives me near by perfect shave and it's smooth too which makes it even better. Apart from the quality of the blade, the trimmer itself is quite durable so it will surely gonna last longer.. So if you are planning to buy one you can surely give it a thought.. Thanks for reading the review. Cheers !",4
"Must buy trimmer... Earlier i used to shape my tiny beard by scissors, and several times it scratched my skin , i have also two cuts on my chin now on which no hair will ever grow...sad but got a lesson don't try to save money so the time actually first time i bought nova trimmer which was a cheap , a***** trimmer , i don't know why people buy cheap nova products ... Than i purchased this product claiming to get fully charged in 1 hour.... And surprisingly it's true...this is an awesome product from philips..it trims mind blowing , i don't keep a brard , actually i just grow my beard till no. 4 on trimmer u can say , and it's best for mee too , o trim at 2.5 setting and its looks good...better than clean shave.... I have also dropped it 6 times..but hola , nothing happened to it.... Blades are easy to clean , after trimmming take the blades out and wash it under high pressure of water under the tap..... Battery life is too awesome , i charge it once in a month and it easily gives 5_6 shaves.... Overall mindblowing awesome product....worth buying",5
"Really a good trimmer considering built quality, functionality, batter life, etc. It works the way its described. Helps grooming easy and without going to saloon every alternate day.. Only one negative point I feel is its broad blades may not be helpful always when it comes to grooming smaller portions near moustache and also not that precise when need to pick hairs closely without comb.. But overall a good product to maintain beard.",5
This product is overated i believe and may be made up.. It may be good for the new beard young men or teens with whiskers.. For people with rough beard this is just a useless toy.I had to pass it over my beard nearly 15 times to get the required grooming and the grooming is was not even and clean.I ultimately had to use the razor and do a clean shave.. I am not sure whether the product i received is faulty or this is how it works.I am really dissatisfied with it.,2
"In past I have used Syska trimmer and it was not good at all due to power issues. So I bought this Philips trimmer and I can say that this is the best trimmer at this price. I am using this trimmer since March 2020 and it's really a good product. It requires only 60 minutes to charge and once charged, you can use this trimmer for more than 2 hours. That is the best thing about this trimmer. You can use this trimmer for body grooming as well but with care.",5
"After lot of research, bought this product. I'm using this product for more than 3 years and I have to say this, you will be blown away by the product.. Don't have second thought, just buy this product. You can use it while charging or you charge it and use it later. Charging will be don't in just 45 mins. Best product out there in this price bracket. Easy to use and clean.. If you find this review helpful, please select helpful button.. Cheers!!!",5
Philips product is All time Best. I already Use many Philips product. Now I Bought PHILIPS CORDED & CORDLESS TRIMMER it's very useful and good product. Battery life is very good 1 hour of charging it gives 2 to 3 hours of Battery life for me.. And full charge it give very good Battery life. And next it is very easy to use just take the trimmer and start using with one press ON Button. AFTER USE EASY TO CLEAN.. trimmer open slot is given in the Top of the trimmer just open and clean in the given Brush including in the product.. All over the Philips trimmer product is very good.,5
"This was my first trimmer of life.I have been using it for last 3 years without any problem and it's still working like the first day.. Pros :. 1)I like its battery a lot.With just 1h of charging,I can use it for 90 minutes which is quite good.. 2)The blades are really good.Initially I thought I would have to change it but the blade is still good without any performance decrease.You can also wash it with water by opening the blades.. 3) It's super skin friendly.I was very much worried about using a trimmer as I have sensitive skin.I can guarantee that it's one of the best skin friendly trimmers.You can just run it on your face without any doubt.You will not feel any pain.. 4)You can get 1 year extended warranty if you register from Philips website(in total,you will have 3 years warranty which is quite good and rare). 5)The build quality is good.I dropped it multiple times mistakenly but nothing happened.. 6)If you use it precisely with its 20 length settings,you can have a really good look.. 7) Though it's a beard trimmer,I used it to cut my underarm hairs and it worked well.. Cons :. 1)At this budget,a waterproof body is expected so that we can wash the whole body with water but unfortunately just blades are washable.. Overall, it's good without any problems.",5
"Quick points. Using for a few months now and what stands out is. * The battery: Great for cordless use. I can use it for 2-3 sessions without recharging, and of course the LED will blink informing you when to charge. * The packaging. Comes in a compact box and also has a travel pouch for you to take it along (havent used it yet though). It also has a small brush for cleaning the machine, but I found that it is not that great in removing the hairs stuck inside it (Either that or I don't know to use it). Otherwise this is a solid product and worth it!",5
"After using this product for almost a year, I write this review. The product is extremely useful (personally, my uasge with the device is light)- it has both wireless & wired use options. However, the battery life is quite long, and after a single charge, I don't find myself having to charge it again for many months (although I am a light user & my usage is limited to a 5-min trim once every 2 weeks at max). For me, this is the biggest winning factor of the product.. The price at which I bought it was extremely extremely reasonable (thanks to Great Indian Shopping Fest) amd hence I found this purchase a complete value for money.. There are 5 modes for trimming, depening upon the thickness of the facial hair, though I haven't had to use many of them (I just stick to the default). Hope this helps you all who are looking to buy a trimmer for a reasonable price. For me, this product is a 5/5",5
"The best beard trimmer available in India...with quick charging that lasts for at least 7 -8 times usage(obviously this would vary according to your frequency and duration of use). Cutting precision is pretty good...some people complained skin cutting or burn...but personally I have not experienced those.... Go for it without any doubt...I have been using Philips trimmer for quite a time...I bought the last one 6 yrs ago..it's still working ...but of course battery has worn out.... This trimmer has a very short charging time compared to others...it last long....precise cutting..you can remove the head,wash it separately....and no need of oiling the blades.... Go for it",4
"Philips products are always with good quality.. I am using this product from last 5 years. No single problem till date. Fast changing facility is awesome. Only one small problem is, facing Charging issue from 5th year as battary is getting drain within 5 min after full charge. But I feel it's not a big problem as we have direct plug-in and use facility for this Trimmer.",5
"I've been wanting to buy this for years now! Always been hesitant, because I've tried over 5 different electric shavers. Nothing came close to a razor, until I finally pulled the plug on this. Seriously, this is not like any other electric shaver!!! It works wonders, especially when used as directed!!! I cannot stress this enough. If you been hesitant about buying it. Now, it's your time. I liked it so much that I got one for my Dad. He loves it too!!!",5
"Good Battery Life.. Smooth Cut... Easy to Clean.... Single charge(1.5hrs) is enough for nearly Half a Years or say 3-4 months Shave...😂😂. Fine length Adjustments... Blades are Smooth... Though Obviously Not for Clean Shaven look.. Easy Clip on Blade, removable by one Click, Now Clean..!! Easy going...!!",5
Overpriced not worth the money spent. The biggest problem is the charger which is not USB e and the charger is not available easily in the market. And if you go to service centre the charger would cost you 500 rupees. Add 200 more and get a new one but this model is definitely not worth overhyped falsely reviewed,1
"As described. Genuine product delivered . Extended warranty of 3 year available on registering at philips website.. Updating the review after 2 years of use, the battery has stopped charging and shaver doesn't work any more. I am yet to take it to service centre but there are not many Phillips service centre in India. So probably it is not that good a deal, taking away one star for product malfunction after 2years.. Updating the review after showing the product on service centre in July 2020 - philips has replaced the trimmer with Brand NEW one . So restoring full stars.",5
"I have used it for a month or so now. Ordered during lockdown out of compulsion. Of course works well for trimming your beard of course. But, I also used it to cut my dad's hair one day and i was happy with the results.. Tip is to use the trimmer with low setting (0.5 or 1) but without cap. Instead of using the cap for managing the length, use a comb and the machine to get the length right. At least initially when the volume is too high. Its a bit tricky and you can end up cutting it too short- but that's not the product's fault. Bottomline is, you can cut hair with it.",5
Writing this review after 2months of use.. First I tried looking for some low cost brand but after little amount of research I found this as good option.. Pros. -Easy to use. -Battery life-just charge it once leave the rest for few hours of use.. I can account amount of time I have charged it.. -Light weight.. -Brand and warranty is another option.. Cons.. IL let u know if I find any.. It's the best of all the trimmers i used just that it doesn't give that clean shave look.. Rest all it's fine don't look around for some bucks go for this.,5
Very good product actually. Takes way less time to charge than other trimmers. Excellent for first time users. 2 disadvantage if to pinpoint is:. 1) length setting can be better like upto atleast 15mm. (I literally don't wanna 0.5 mm increase after 5 or 6mm). 2) little difficulty in cleaning. OTHERWISE totally worth it. Would be a great buy. Writing after 3 years after purchase,4
"I bought this since it said ""AA battery required"". My current Philips trimmer is almost dead after 2 years and I cannot remove the battery. Sadly, I find that even this one does not allow removal. So when the battery becomes weak, the item is useless.",2
if u remove the red cap for cleaner trim it start giving cuts after 40 sec of working and the blade become hot .. BATTERY AND LIFE IS VERY DURABLE BUT NOT SKIN FRIENDLY,1
I used it for a year and then it was lost somehow.... at the point of time it was not available in market.. i was forced to buy another Phillips model and then i realized the quality of this product. Packing was very good - proper brush was 2 sided and very good. blades were also good. I used this for trimming beard twice a week and used to charge this once in 20 days....,5
"Just how well can this product be can be judged by my insane act of rinsing the insides of this under a running tap. Only later did I realize (after reading the manual), that its NOT water proof. Lesson learned, and it continues to function without any glitch. Love it since that day.",5
"This is the best trimmer I’ve ever used, easy to use easy to clean it work like charm ... the battery life is super amazing after several use I completely drain it and after I give it a full charge, it lasts for 2 weeks or more if you just trim your beard, highly recommended to all my bros out there.... P.S : JUST DO IT !!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂(reference to Shia Labeouf meme)",5
"Either comb is complete waste or it is stuck. Any setting i try, it only trims at 1mm when using comb.. So effectively my trimmer has been reduced to two settings only 0.5mm and 1mm.. Also why isn't the comb normal, like in other ones. Here its in bent shape for fitting in trimmer, it does fit well but i think it would have been better if it were simpler like in the pic.. I tried it for two months, never got any satisfactory results.",1
"Though it's too late for writing this review, but it's fine. I am writing this review after 3 years of extensive using. I would say, it is awesome. Battery runs a month. And the motor, blade, etc. are awesome. I would recommend to buy the trimmer of successive models.",5
"Well the battery life is good and fast charging is also good, the bad part is the adjusting the blade to set a length is not accurate, at first I taught the blade would adjust according to the size but no it's just the outer part (red color) which adjusts according to the lenghth you set.. When it comes to cleaning it's good and you need to wash them according to the information provided in the Manuel, the blades tend to become warm if you don't clean them when you're shaving. I usually cleane the blade every time when I'm shaving or after shave I don't wash my blade cause it may rust or the blade may become blunt .",4
"I had researched a lot before buying this trimmer and have been very happy using it. I have used it 7-8 times till now and it has been very easy to use and to handle, cleaning it takes time but it is worth the effort. I did not have to charge it till now so i can see the durability of its charge.. Very happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a Trimmer.",5
This worked only one time for me. The second time I had to use this was after 15 days and it didnt work. Amazon refuses to take this back as health-care products return policy is within 10 days. I believe other users also had the same problem. I wish I had read the reviews first.. Dont know what to do with this now. Amazon washed off their hands by saying I should contact the manufacturer.,1
"This Philip trimmer is best of under 2k category because its has a tremendous battery life and charging time is also less than other trimmer, it has a blinking light which shows battery is still charging and if its stops blinking than its 100% charged.... The plastic quality of trimmer is very good and its come with 20 adjustable length which helps in cutting hair by your own length.... Finaly its come with a high quality pouch which u can use for carry outside & lastly the lengh of the charging cord is nice and u can use trimmer with plugin also.... {THE TRIMMER DOESN'T HAVE USB TYPE CHARGING PIN}.",5
Well i have never used any other trimmers besides this. So i have nothing to compare it to. But it does what i bought it for. Only charged it twice in the last 3 months. It charges quite fast around 1 hour i guess. And lasts very long. Thought it gets hot very quickly for some reason. But it does not reduce any functionality,5
The battery life is very awesome once you charge and use it it will also work after the 10 to 15 days even after a month you find that the it's what she is remain charge and you can use it three to four times that Titanium plates are don't trust so the life of this trimmer is very long Great product,4
"Its a lovely trimmer, trims nicely and you can trim any body hair except ""you now which ones""!. Its sleek, smooth, fast, nice battery life, sharp blades and not so loud hum.. Its serving me well, honestly..Good price.. Oh yes, its not a wet trimmer (read ""don't use foam or lather"") and also not for animals so don't try fancy stuff on your pets with these.. Its Philips, so yes good parts and all good.. Go for it...its worth that money..",5
"Purchased on February 2016.. After One Year Usage The Blades Stopped Working (bit lose gap between motor and blades spinner), Fixed it With Adding some paper/cloth piece in between motor and blades Spinner.. In 2nd Year 2018 - The Batteries Died :-D. Replaced the batteries with new Duracell AAA Batteries :-D Working Fine Now.. Purchased Extra 4 For Friends in 2017.",4
"My second trimmer from Philips first one lasted for i guess over 4 or 5 years so that's a lot of time.. It is, still usable but because of battery life I thought about buying this one so everything is same just battery life is incredible and all u need a hour of charge.. So can use it even when you are in hurry and i gets discharged.. So just go for it",5
"Bought it a few months ago and it has fared really well till now! It is a great buy at this price range. Would fully recommend!. Features I liked:. - Quick charge (~2 hours). - Blades are sharp; the 27 lock-in length settings are really useful. - Battery life is strong - the light indicates when the battery is about to die (so you don't have to be taken aback in the middle of a trim). The light also indicates charging and fully charged modes - very convenient. - Easy to hold, ergonomic design. Just the 1 catch for me:. - It cannot be used wet (cannot be cleaned under running water either) - however, the comb and the blades can be removed and washed separately",5
"I bought this trimmer two years ago before flying out of india. I have been using this for quite some time now and i feel that i can write a very apt review for this product.. Pros :. 1) Highly durable. 2) Good grip. 3) It's handle shape makes it easy to hold and rotate. 4) Super battery life. 5) Convenient blade height settings. Cons :. 1) Cannot clean it properly. I use it once every 2 months to trim my hair as haircut is very expensive in the country where i live now. Almost 3/4th of my haircut is possible on battery and afterwards i have to connect it to supply. If you just use it for beard and under-arm trimming, it would last for over 1-2 months, depending on the beard length and how rough/smooth your beard is.",5
"The trimmer is good. It chacrges quickly with cool led notification light. It is very light and slim. It cuts beard hair easily. However, if ur beard hair are too dense and thick it do not go through the red safety brush/grill as the space between is bit less.. It does work when its corded or cordless also it NOT waterproof",4
"Excellent and outstanding product,one of the best models from Philips trimmer, quality is best,charges within 50-60 minutes and can be used for 2 to 2:30 hours continuously.I was searching for the trimmer from very long time and my search ended up with this.",5
One of the best trimmer ever I used.. Product is so good. Used almost 1.5 years. But suddenly stopped working. When contacted cc got to know no service center available in my district. Due to lock down I couldn't travel for within 2 years guarantee period of time. All its over. after sales services aren't good. You have to expenses for traveling. What is the use of it having 2 years warranty. Bad for service in terms of repairing,3
"Well this trimmer needs no introduction. Even after 5 years of use it's working fine. Only battery drains much faster, else the device precision is great. With new trimmers they have come up with better extentions. Recently i have seen that they have increased the price of this piece a lot. This is not good as the same old material is being sold 300 400 bucks higher.",5
"I bought this product in 2014 from Amazon only. Till now this product has been the only shaver I use. Never disappointed. Battery life is good and charges quickly. Now all of a sudden after 6 yrs of thorough usage the battery gave up. Now I have to use it is corded, At this moment also this product still market leader. I think I'll buy another one if I cannot get a battery for cheap. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to buy this product, there is not a single negative thing I can say about it.",5
Untill and unless you save and take care of this thing it will go for a long life it's been 3 years and still working fine although I trim my beard once in 3 weeks so it depends on you how you use it....other than that if you have a habit of cleaning it after use and storing it properly then quality doesn't matter you can use it for life or till when the battery runs down....,5
"After buying this I thought I will never be able to buy a new trimmer, but finally after 4 years of usuage I broke this trimmer. This thing is built like a rock but make sure to keep it away from water. I burned the motherboard because I left it near the sink for months and finally water got into it. Going to buy this again cause there is no trimmer in the market which can beat this build quality.",5
Using for more than 4 years to trim hair and beard. The inner rotor got detached by heat roughly after 3 years. I am using this by pushing inner rotor firmly everytime before use at once. The support of philips is good and its spare parts are available(I am saying because I got one). Overall the Trimmer is very good. The machine works with direct charging supply. Thanks philips.,5
I bought it 4 second time.. Not as before.. waste of money.. hard blades.. not as expected..,1
The product does not deliver very close trims. The closeness of the trims will keep on reducing with every usage. Within the first year only the battery started giving issues. The trimmer gets discharged on its own even if the charger is showing full charge sign.,3
"This Philips trimmer is good. But there is a issue with the seller.. Quick charging.. Nice battery backup.. On corded trimming.. Nice seamless trimming.. Cool design.. Well grip to hold.. Overall a nice choice.... Seller (cloudtail) was delivered the Parker pen of ₹ 250/- in place of trimmer.. Even after complaining several times, the seller blaming on me that I was lying. They refused to accept that they had sent me the wrong product. It was terrifying that such a reputed Seller(cloudtail) was doing such ashamed activity.. It was not expected to such a seller and at such a platform (Amazon).. After several complaints to Amazon my problem is resolved finally.",5
"This is good product for beard trimming. Don't ever think of using this for hairstyle, if you are not a pro in it. Since the length adjuster given with this works only for beard and not a easy one for hairs. This has excellent battery, in the first run after full charge I used it for almost an hour and the battery is still available for use, all this with one full charge.",4
I have been using a Panasonic trimmer for the Past 4 years . Thought I needed a change from the Brand for some thing better thus after reading so many reviews ended up with Philips .But after receiving the Product I was disappointed with it especially the NOISE . Its loud really loud . Now looking back at my Panasonic it's a gem.,2
"I bought this product in October 2017 for price 1,679 Rupees.. Really this product is awesome. the battery is very good. With one hour charging, we can use for shaving more than 8 times. I am using weekly once. After one year use still, the battery is good.. we can use this with and without the cord and this will give smooth shave also.. One problem I observed is cord wire length is small and don't know where can we buy if this cord not working. Apart from this Product is good",4
I was using a vega trimmer before I decided to try this promising model. The following are my views after one use.. 1. Battery life for which i have purchased the product is pretty bad. I charged the product for 5-6 hrs before using. On my first use only got about fourty minutes of battery power before the trimmer comes to a complete halt.. 2. The product claims to give one shave in five minutes of charging. I charged for 10min but got only about one minute of trimmer running. Clearly too short time to get a shave.. Conclusion: Apart from good looks its more or less the same as vega charger which I bought for around 600 bucks.,2
"size adjustment : Don't bother ! its not that effective , also depend how you hold it and how much u press against your skin. battery Life: Extra point for its battery . single charge run for long. I tried styling and shaping my hair with it but its of no use. simply use it for beard trimming and body hair shaving if you want .. its my 3rd year with it. 3 star for it",3
"The mains plug of the charger with this item is not compatible with the Indian Electric standard socket, may result in serious accedent. The pins are so thin & not as per the inner diameter of the socket. Strongly recomonded not to buy untill & unless they will consider the security of the Indian customer. SECURITY FIRST. For sale any item in country, MUST be as per the standard of that country.",1
Best beard trimmer i have tried till date. I have tried Wahl Philips Braun and now this model of Philips.. It's easy to use and angling n grip is amazing adjustment of height is very easy and in two strokes it manages to clean it all.. Only thing it could be better at is if it had precision trim head for some close finish and waterproofing,5
Philips is one of the brands which provide you with its Best Products.. I have Used this Product for many days & it is really a good product.. Charging of the trimmer is really quite fast compared to Other Trimmers.. Battery life after not even charging it full is great.. Trimmer's Performance is perfect.. The Only Small request from Philips that Please make the inner body water resistant like he MI Beard Trimmer.. Which will help us to Clean it by Water more Easily.. Rest is Perfect.. Nice Work with Self-Sharpening Titanium blade.,5
"Function of blades is very very poor, not cleaning properly and bit painful, I previously used cheaper QT 4001/15 for 4years..as that machine not getting charged., wanted to upgrade to this, but Even now the blades of old one is much smoother than the new one.. I am using old blades with new machine",1
Good option for daily purposes. I gifted this trimmer to my brother. He is highly satisfied with its quality and battery life. It really gets charge very fast. Quick charge option is also available. It's blades are really of very good quality. Please do register your product on philips website. It's completely free. They sometimes gives you extra warranty on registration.,5
"I was using QT4001 for over a period of 6 years but the trimmer finally gave up after extensive usage. Now that I want to upgrade and stick to the same brand I chose this one, easy bet, It didn't fail to impress me. Loving the product overall. I was hankering for that corded solution when you knew that you forgot to put them on charge in the last minute. 5 star.",5
"I ordered this product coz I wanted a trimmer that work with/without cord, it also had 3 years warranty. But after receiving the product I felt that trimmer is over priced. Blade set and clip is not of good quality and the space with trimmer and blade is too much hence not easy to clean. Also I noticed that it doesn't change the precision of blade when setting is change.. Also physical damage is not covered in warranty so it's of no use to buy such costly product.. Hence I returned it.. You can give it a try if u want to.",2
"I have been using this since last 6 months now and I am pretty happy with its quality. It does not take much time to get charged and once charged, I can use it for long time, at least 10 15 times. Product was well packed and delivered on time. But you will not get any Phillips packaging. It will be just a plain cartoon box because of which I was initially a bit doubtful about its authenticity. But so far it is working as expected. It did not give any problem so far.",5
Its the 2nd time i have bought this product from amazon .Its a perfect product for me. Pros-. Easy to use. Have sets of options for setting your beard length. Long battery hours. Parts easily available. Con -. Just 1 because after using it for 2 years the battery backup was not up to the mark other wise its a perfect product,5
"I ordered it on the 23rd of April after the initial lockdown and recieved it on 12th may, I understand that the postal service were severely affected. I used it to trim my hair once and shave maybe a dozen times, Now that we are again undergoing a total lockdown for a fortnight, I tried to use it for trimming my moustache today but was in for a surprise. It would not cut and was literally pulling each and every moustache. I ensured that all was clean and also the charge was full but to no avail. Maybe it was a one off incident with me but sadly the return window is closed. Will try getting in touch with the Phillips Customer care.",3
This particular type of trimmer has very sharp blades and can bruise while trimming the side burns. The design and shape is not at all perfect for me instead the new philips Bt 3215 is a good value for the money.,1
"Very old product dilivered. Colour of the supporting papers have turned yellow as if the packing is very old or any manipulation has been done. Returned at once. Thanks Amazon for the return. But Amazon will have to be particular regarding the quality of products. When I tried to use it , its blade was not working",1
I had used quite a few beard trimmer and it's the best one so far and absolutely justifies the premium. The build quality is excellent and sturdy as expected. I'm happy I choose this over cheaper alternatives. I have been using it for several months now and would recommend this in a heartbeat.,5
The blades are very sharp if you moves very lightly on skin then also you damaged skin or it cuts a skin.Please use this product very carefully. First apply lots of powder on skin and then on powder u slowly move machine.,1
"A trimmer for all men out there. Easy to use, has a good battery and charges up quick... 1 hour of charge for 90 minutes of usage. Branding of Philips has shown premium too. Self sharpening blades and precision of up to 0.5mm is all what was required. Although I was happy with the product, I had some uncertainty about the comb provided.. as you can see the comb seems to have high chances of breakage. But that isn't a problem as there are service centers that can provide you a replacement if you ever break it accidentally. You'll have to spend Rs.150/- to get one. Last time I replaced such a comb costed me Rs.150 /- rounded. This is my second trimmer from Philips. Trusted product.. The delivery by Amazon was on time as usual. Had no delays or excuses from their side. Package was good. Tightly packed. Yet I expected a bigger package, as my previous trimmer came in a bigger package. No issues every product has its own package. 😄",5
"It's the first time I'm using a Philips trimmer. I saw great product reviews for this trimmer, that's why I selected this model. But I didn't feel that this product is great compared to the price. The motor is having average power - not the powerful one, the clipper feels very very cheap and the most important thing is it won't cut low lying facial hair as the clipper head is having a round edge. If you want to keep a stubble beard, try trimmers having pointing clippers for lifting low lying hairs",3
"This little monster is worth your every penny! I bought this product in October and posting this review after 5 months of usage.. Product packaging was good. Product is genuine. Make sure you register on the official website to claim the additional warranty. Coming to the performance review :. Ease of use : 10/10. Battery usage : 10/10. Device stability : 8/10 (after 30 mins the blades do heat up a bit and the device does makes a stressful sound ). Device build : 8/10 ( the guard is made up of plastic, doesn't looks much durable though, hopefully I haven't dropped it yet :P ). Charging time : 10/10. Tha device's battery does retain sufficient charge. I have gone weeks before recharging it and yet the device works like a charm.",4
I used for long time and it's good product to groom your beard with different size. It's easy to clean moter area and you can wash plastic comb. Make sure after every use of you wash the blade then you need to apply oil to blades for long time use.,4
"Definitely one of the best trimmer you will get.. But, You will not get oil for this trimmer, that's bad because you need it and every other trimmer provide it.. And also, the power of trimmer drops. I mean I have this trimmer for about a year and only used it a few times still it feels considerably slower that what it used to be when it was new.",4
"Very good trimeer ..Philips at his best .. Very sharp hair cutting with no any cuts on skin . I am using this trimmer from 1 month it's easy to use , for cleaning we have to give a little bit time .. Battery - long lasting for 2 hour & carging is also very fast .. Amazon has also given delivery in specified date & time , in lock dowen also .. Those who wants to use first time also , they can go for this trimeer ..Philips a reliable brand .",4
"As I mentioned that I'm using this trimmer from last two years. Still this is working as like a new new trimmer. Very happy with it.. It's blades stay extra-sharp to always cut hairs neatly and effectively, but have rounded blade tips and combs to prevent irritation.. Whenever you want to look your very best, I recommend only Philips, because it has the right grooming solution for you",5
"I've been using this for about one and a half years now, and the quality hasn't degraded at all. It's an excellent product. I'm never going back to those Chinese products that you have to replace ever few months.. Great battery life. It's fairly easy to use and rinse. Gives a nearly clean shave at the lowest setting. If you have unfortunately used the flimsy Chinese ones and you get your hands on one of these you can tell right away this one is far superior hearing that purr of the motor and noticing just the way it feels in your hands.",5
Let me be very honest.... I purchased this product 2 days ago. I.e 25 may 2k19. .. It feels premium in hands but the plastic adjustable cap like thing used to adjust length is very cheap and waste... it will easily break if it falls from 1 feet height and the twist in the story is you can't even claim for the warrenty because they don't cover any physical damage issue under their warrenty policy.... That cap will cost you 300 to 400 rupee. You and buy a complete trimmer from Nova in its cap's price segment.... Conclusion: it's not worthy for two thousand.. You can buy 5 average quality physical trimmers(or more) in this price and use them for 1.5 hours continuously after charging overnight.... The best part is... you'll get get(or more) physical machine that'll last longer than 5 years.... Complete waste trimmer,3
"Personal favorite item as I'm using it from since 4.5 years ( Order placed in Feb. 2015 ). No any single issue. Water resistant. You can use it with cord as well as cordless ( after charging ). Long Battery life. 27 lock-in length settings, 0.5 - 10mm with 0.5mm precision. Comes with carry pouch with small cleaning brush",5
I had purchased this last September and hardly used it few times...now it doesn't charge..,1
"Brand is always a brand.. Once charged and I used for almost 20 to 25 and more. 100% battery is awesome.. Blade quality is very high.. Caution: needs attention when using in private parts as I said blades are sharp, its doesn't mean it cuts your beard skin and absolutely perfect for face.. Review given after 4 months of using it",5
I have used this trimmer twice now. It was primarily for a bald hair though it's a beard trimmer it didn't habe any issue.. Battery is real good and will give you a full session on hair and beard in one full charge.. Charging also happens quickly full charge in about 20 - 30 Min of time( a full drain of battery will take about 15 more min). More suitable for beard as it doesn't help you if you need just a trimming for your hair but for beard it's very good.,5
"This can cut really head hair as well and with ease. BUT don't compare it to a trimmer which is specifically for head with certain attachment.. If u use machine set at number 3, u will get a cut similar to no. 1 cut by your barber.The product is really easy to use.. The box came in neatly packed.. Opened and the battery was fully charged and so was me, so completely shaved off my head, and now enjoying the cool breeze.. Again reiterating this is not a hair trimmer, but a beard trimmer but capable of trimming your hair.",5
"The trimmer is great. It works like a charm. Charging it once leaves it working for ages. It barely needs frequent charging if you trim only your beard.. The blades are perfect and cut without any tug or pull to cause pain.. The best part is not even that. Mine stopped working all of A sudden and it was just charging without turning on. Within 3 hours of me logging a request, a service personnel came home and collected the device. The ne xt day he came back and returned it without any charge! I was blown away by the philips service. Double thumbs up.",5
"I've been using this product for past 4½ years and its still working fine for me. Just a flaw in the battery is that after using for 4 years, the trimmer is not charging and is working only with simultaneous charging.. Now after using is for almost every week in 4½years, the blades are also getting a bit blunt, but will still work for another year or 2.. The overall product worked very fine for me in past 4years.. The product quality is also very good and the pouch received with it is still in the perfect shape.. 9/10 🌟 rating.",4
Pros: Cost effective. Easy to clean. Sturdy build and blades. Fast charging and awesome battery performance.. Cons: No zero point trim. Noisy but not too much.. Been using for 6+ months and see no signs of wear.. *Update*: it's going to be 2 years since I bought this. No signs of wear on the blade. Battery life has dropped by 50% though for a single full battery charge and noise is a bit higher than it was initial. But still a great product because it still gets the job done.,4
"Working well till today.. Charges fast and works great.. The only complaint is the plastic detachment looks delicate.. (Though it has not broke or damaged so far but if you handle it roughly or put it in travel bag carelessly among all your luggage it may break). But all in all, a great trimmer.",5
"just rcieved the product, will update after a month regarding the product performance.. packing was sleek and clean though one thing i noticed was the paper box was packed inside out, ie, plain beige paper on the out and laminated blue color philips branding inside,, dont know if its something to do with customs , as the product is made in indonesia.. fit and finish fine with motor producing minimum vibration..",3
"I have been using this product since one week and I want to give a review of it. The Philips QT4011/15 is the best trimmer I have ever used. I have MI beard trimmer and I have used it for about 1 month , it was the worst trimmer I have bought , it has many issues with it , its blade heats up within 5 minutes and it is not bearable us . The philips trimmer do not heats up and also it can be used by me comfortably. We can cut our beard, hair and groom our body hair. Is charges up very quick within 40-42 minutes. Lastly, I want to say , it is the best trimmer in 2000 rupees",5
"I bought it in Oct 2014 and I'm still using the product after 5 years i.e. 2019.. Considering we use it every week, therefore i can confidently say that Philips did not disappoint me at all.. Truely, value for money product.. The only downside that I'm noticing having used it for 5 yrs is the trimmer runs out of battery after 10 mins use. This is now after 5 yrs, and it was not in the initial years.",4
This is worst product. Dont buy. Amazon customer support team worst and they don't support after buying. Amazon selling duplicate product,1
"The product is very very easy to use , clean and also it is very easy to wash the blades. It doesn't cause any kind of problem to your skin like itching. Battery life is good and battery indicator allow you to check if the battery has been full or low and also it indicates when the battery is fully charged.",5
Amazing Trimmer. I even gave myself a hair cut with this and it is super good. Earlier I had phillips trimmer only but it's battery lasted only 15 mins but this one has way longer battery life and it is more powerful. And charges quickly too. It has a charging indicator which lights up completely when it is full charged which is very helpful,5
"I had used same model earlier for 2 years before it stopped working. I had no issues with that one.. This one I ordered cuts my skin, not sure if the piece is defective or what.",1
"Well I ordered it but package had no attachment comb still, based on my past experiences with this model, it the perfect model to have.. Fast charging, low battery indicator and full charge indicator. Also titanium blade is very sharp although be careful if it's your first time trimming.",4
Excellent product. I'm writing this after two months usage. Battery backup is good. Charges pretty quickly. The only thing is it won't give you total clean face as it is a trimmer not shaver. Rest all is good. You can buy this.,5
For this price someone would expect some features apart from good trimming 0.5 mm (there are trimmers available with more closer trim at lower price). 1. Low noise. 2. Solid built quality. 3. Water proof. 4. Close trim. There are the features that this trimmer don't provide for this high price that's why I returned it.,3
"I am giving 4 stars only for 1 factor which is the 'glasy front comb', which is delicate. But this front comb is the key to all your trimming adjustments to work right.l. The product although delicate, works very well. I fear that the 'front comb part' might break if handled a little undiligenlty.. Rest of the product is extremely good. Good battery life and nice trimming adjustments.. Worth the money? I would say yes, except for the glassy delicate 'front comb' part.",4
"Update after 3 months of use: This is a great tool. Easy on skin, does the job well, once charged you can shave for 5 times at least. So one charge should last a month if you shave twice a week. As they are water resistant and self sharpening sound to be a long term product. So go for it.",5
"First of all this trimmer is great for wet and dry use .. Due to its titanium blade on one side, the steel side can get sharpened every time when it's used due to this blade won't bud that easily .. Pros. With half hrs of charge can last for 90 min use. Self sharpening blades. No cons found just go for the purchase",5
I am writing this review after using it for a year. It was fast and durable when it was new. Over the time it started to spin slow and change get down in 30 mins. Moreover the product was not that good after a while.,3
"This is a good product. Full charging in 1 hour, self sharpening titanium blades.. A little issue with the safety comb which cannot take in hair longer than 1.5 inch properly.. But anyway, used it extensively in lockdown to cut my hair by myself.. Will recommend it as charging time is low.",4
"It is a very good product. I just charged it once and was able to use it for over a week for about 15-20 mins every alternate day. Its recharge time is also very less compared with others at this price range.. Don't get clean shave but since it is a trimmer it gives a nice subtle look.. The only concerned I faced was with the packaging, it is delivered in a brown colored box with Phillips logo at the inside instead on the outside of the box. So was concerned if it is a duplicate one but since it solves the purpose and even after having a word with the customer service people seems to be a genuine product.",4
"1. Stopped working after 3 months. I might have used around 6-7 times. Since it was under warranty got it replaced.. 2. Now the motor rotates, but the blade which is connected to the motor stopped moving. Low quality product from Phillips.. 3. I recommend not to buy this product if you are looking for a proper beard trimmer. Not worth the money. You can get better products for the same price.",1
The guard of this trimmer was a bit loose and so the accuracy of the trim dropped by 0.5 to 1mm.. 60 mins charge and 90 mins of power. No other trimmer can beat this. Another advantage is the self sharpening titanium blades.,4
"Dear Buyer, Be informed that, if your battery stops charging after warranty, the service center people deny replacing the battery, suggesting to use the trimmer with cord. Utter nonsense, because, We are paying higher price for Philips to get a quality product that will last longer and MOST importantly we will get SERVICE and can REPAIR it.",3
"Order this product on 4th Oct 2019 and received within a week. When i was put the trimmer in charging it's not charged. I reach my nearest Philips authorised service centre, they said there was a problem in the charger will replace it. After two weeks i got the charger, when they checked it's not working, they said there was a problem in the trimmer will check and revert. I am worry about the product quality. Surprise to see such defective product from Philips. Until now it was not resolved waiting for the service centre call when it's resolved.",1
This is an all rounder. The blades are sharp yet safe( even if it is used without the plastic guard. Very handy and easy to carry. The power it pouches in it is really awesome. A must have tool for personal grooming especially during the lockdown period.,5
I know that this is the best trimmer one can have but i think i got defected one.. The button was pressed below so i cannot take any chance.. i returned it and I'll get a new one.. i hope i get a good and defectless product next time,4
After charging for 2 to 3 hrs also..it doesn't work..what to do..???the motor unit also not rotating,1
"In a similar product purchased few years ago, the washer came off & went missing leading to constant slippage of the small shaft connecting the motor & the blades. This is the reason to buy another identical one. Need service back up from manufacturer.",4
"Reviewing after 4-5 moth of usage. BRIGHT SIDE:. 1)huge running time, 90 minutes will easily cover 20-30 days of usage. 2) will charge in just 2-2:30 hrs. 3)can use while charging. 4)2nd most important is titanium blade (research on that). 5) adjustable size is enough to make styles. 6)easy to handle, maintain and carry. Con: 1) the size adjustable mechanism is kide of breakable and loosely attached, it feels it will not hold tight after many usage",4
"It’s been one month and it appears powerful. I didn’t trim for two week so I had a pretty much a thick stash of beard, but with one move it rid me off the beard. This does get charged very quickly, although I didn’t make note of time. 4 years back this would’ve costed at least 4K",4
This is almost size of your palm. Its good for having a clean look to diffrent size beard. Unless someone comes feeling your breath the smallest setting gives you the nearest shave. Plus the blades are not sharp and doesnt cause irritation.,5
"Very much handy, robust, battery life good, overall good experience till date. But recently I have lost my charger of this product, new one is costing me 650 rs around which is very much costly compared with total price of device i.e. 2000rs. Charger should be universal type so we can use mobile charger also if original one gets misplaced.. Means accessories are product specific and costlier.. I think this is only drwaback I have experienced till date.",4
"This product is awesome ,. Bettery is excellent,. Easy to use.. I have purchased this trimmer in 2015 at 1395,. Now it's blade is not working and bettery is not charging properly.. I have used this trimmer 4 years (approx.). I have used it roughly still it's performance is excellent.. Value for money.. I suggested other two of my friends to buy the same .. Thanks to Amazon & Philips for such an amazing product.",5
It's very useful to have a cord with a cordless trimmer. I have previously used cordless trimmer so it's definitely a worth to have cord along with it for better using of it. Charges very fast and lasts long. I really use cord during its usage as it works seemlesly without it. Easy handling and gripping design to accompanying with easy cleaning process.,4
Using this from past 4 years and turns out the fantastic purchase.. Got warranty of 3 years (2 years standard and 1 year for online registering). Had faced some issue in 3rd year with battery but got it replaced from service center.. Good after sale service is provided by Phillips.. Runs with charging cable attached as well so no worries about the battery. One have to be careful while using it on body parts other than beard as it can make you bleed.,5
"Philips trimmer are very good. This is my second trimmer in 7 years. The reason I had to buy new one was just that I choose the grow beard, otherwise my old trimmer is still working good.. This trimmer's bettery life is very good and it's is very easy to use. And also very easy to clean. And it also takes very less time to get fully charged",5
Works like magic for trimming beard and get perfect look. Blad it great. Need to clean 3-4 times during trimming process of heavy beard to work smooth. Bettary life goes after 3-4 years then also we can use it plug and play,5
The first pic shows it is little tempered just down below the philips logo on the trimmerl(white marks visible).. Philips box is also not included.. Just a cardboard box with philips sticker.. I hope it's genuine and not a fake one.. But really not happy.. It looks little bit old. 😟,1
Writing this after 1 year of use.. I use this trimmer once every 3 days (15 to 20 minutes each). It takes around 1 hour to fully charge the device and one charge lasts two weeks. The blades are still working flawlessly.. Solid build and quality product.,4
"Expected better quality from Philips. HAir gets stuck to the adjuster and it make s a mess to remove that and start again. I had old Philips trimmer that I bought 4 years back, that I still use. Due to existing one being too old and plastic wire getting cracked, bought this as backup. Not satisfied after using multiple times and prefer using old trimmer only. Overall just OK OK, not as good as I hoped.",3
"If you want a personal trimmer, just buy this with your eyes closed. Very good battery life. It will last for 3, 4 years easily for personal use, so also buy an extra comb clip now. Because the comb clip is the only thing which is likely to break. Because you won't find the spare comb clip after 3, 4 years. So Better to buy one now.",5
"Half an hour charging and roughly two hour usage.. Good trimmer. I bought this when a friend of mine recommended. The major advantage is the smoot trimming. Blade quality is excellent. It glides very smooth on the skin without any irritation. This is the best I have used so far. I have bought it for 2050.. I would recommended this trimmer. Also, if you register online on the philips website, you get 1 year extended warranty, making it a total of 3 years. That's amazing 😉.",5
Compare to the price I think the quality should be more good but it's quality is average not so much good and when I charge first time this trimmer get very heat I surprise when I touch after half an hour it's very hot so I have takeout the plug so I thik if I charge more then half an hour it may be blast I thik it's danger that much heat when charge this product,2
"I have brought the same product second time. My first one got automatically switched on, when some boxes are moved and all the battery drained and also there is no lock for the switch, when kept in box. Product is good for trimming beard. Extra attachments should have been provided for hair cutting and nose plug. Basic product and does the job intended for. Battery back up is good. Should handle with care.",4
"You can use it corded or plugged in when you don’t have time to wait for it to charge and it is one of the best trimmers.. The sharpening blades with rounded tips and it has combs for a skin-friendly experience.. Has easy to select lock in settings with the precision of 0.5 mm best trimmers for men.. It takes just 1 hour to charge fully. When charged fully, it gives a cordless performance of 90 minutes.. It comes with a travel and storage pouch",5
I've been using this product for years now. And this has been one of my best purchases from Amazon.. PROS. 1)Extremely easy to use even for first timers. 2) A quick fix to your facial hair - consumes just five minutes of your time. 3) Great product if you're looking for maintaining a beard and require regular shave. CONS. 1) The battery life is good but can be better. After regular usage you'll notice a dip in the battery perfomance,5
I am ordering this trimmer second time . As I am using its previous version since last three years. It is the best trimmmer as it is easy to use and more easy to clean. The various trimming levela lets you choose what amount you want to trim. The best part is good battery life. It takes time to charge but once is charged it can be used several times. Affordable and Cheap and good trimmer,5
Its a nice product... Charging is a plus point.. Where normal trimmers require 8 hrs to fully charge.. It takes only an hour... Caution : dont use it to trim pubic hair... U myt cut urself coz of the clippers.,4
"After buying the trimmer i used it for the 1st time. Overall the product is good. It gets recharged in 1 hr unlike others that take 8-10 recharging, that is the reason i bought this trimmer. But one thing i want to mention is the blades are too sharp. I had got cuts on my under arms after using it. Dont use the trimmer without the red extension or else u will also get wounds. Please be extra cautious while using.",5
"Talking about performance, very satisfied. Haven't faced any nicks/cuts yet. Close enough trim at 0, amd the size adjuster works very well. Battery backup is very good. Got it during great indian festival sale. Had the price been even lower, would have happily given full 5 points",4
"I recently purchased it for casual trimming it does what its meant for, I started trimming right after unboxing it and it did last for my whole trim to complete. Overall am satisfied with it, If you need a basic trimmer which does the job when you need it is the one for you....",4
"Using since September 2017.. Perfect for grooming, hair trimming, manscaping.. Battery charging takes an hour and runs for more than 2 hours.. Using it daily and charging once in 15 days.. Battery life:10/10. Easy to use: 10/10. Easy to clean:9/10",5
"It met my expectations. It's a good product and does what's intended well. I bought it for my father, to trim his hair and it's working fine. Have used it twice in the past two months and no issues noted so far. I just wish cleaning off the cut hair from this trimmer was easier too (they've provided a very small brush, sort of). But that's just a minor point. If you're also looking for something like this to trim hair (especially with all the lockdown and stuff) I'd suggest this is good and you can go for it.",4
Using It from almost 8 years. I use it once in a week. Zero pointer works really well.. Battery started troubling after 6 years but still using the same battery and using it by connecting charger.. Got it for 1100 rupees,5
"It cut my beard hair after trying10 times on same place. Many times it's just move as comb only, no hair cut. The battery life is also not as much as they mentioned. Use less. Waste of money. Waste of time also because it took so much time to cut hair.",1
"It's been two years after I bought and started using this Philips trimmer.. It's really worth the money that we pay.. Charges up in just an hour and once fully charged, battery lasts impressively longer.. Has an led indicator which blinks in red if the battery is low, blinks green when charging and glows continuously when the battery is fully charged.. Higly recommended...",5
"If you are a beginner and willing to style your beard, you should better opt out of this because it is a bit tough to get a uniform trim from this one. The comb is not fine enough and it doesn't lift your hair well.. But if you are an experienced user this is a good option. It has a very good battery life, light and easy to handle because of its compact size.",4
"i am using this from ladt 1 year, i am writing this review after one yr. product is good, but battery life is not so good, after charging, run very fast but after 15 min, goes slow again.. design is not good, every time remove blade for clean, hair tuck inside, Philips can improve design, bcoz price is high as compare to features and other products.",4
"This is THE Best trimmer. With all point view. I m using from 5 years, now I ordered same trimmer this model because the last trimmer which I m using battery gone. But I m very happy with this product also. thanks Amazon for packing and sending in good condition.",5
I don't expect this type of trimer in Philips. Past 5years I used Panasonic trimer is exlent performance . Today it's self working condition. Only battery was dead. So I purchased Philips trimer. It's not working properly,1
Trimmer is looks nice on hand and it works smoothly... pros- 1. less charging time 1 hr charging for 90 minutes usage... 2. Nice look. 3. titanium blades. 4. 3 year warranty. 5. Good brand. cons- 1. High priced... It should be approx 15-16 k but i got it in 18k.... 2. packaging is different from those which i saw in youtube videos.... Thanks Philips & Amazon !!,5
"I was looking this trimmer for almost 2 years and finally purchased. This trimmer will provide you comfortable trimming at any kind (dense/light/medium) of beard.. The beauty on this trimmer is you can use this as both corded/cordless means if the charge is down, you can continue trimming by plugging the trimmer in charge which is not possible in any other models under this price.. Finally I will recommend this product to everyone who needs a very good trimmer at best price. Product features are excellent in all aspects.. -Manoj.",5
"What a freedom for just 1800/-, this is giving me at least 5 sessions before drying out and yet why worry, it will still work corded. Wish i should have bought this sooner instead of looking like a caveman when my old trimmer used to take 15 hours to fully charge and give only 5 minutes of backup",5
"Hardly used the product 3-4 times and now it doesn’t even start working. Charged the product as mentioned in the user manual yet it seems battery dead. Regretting not purchasing it through a vendor (Face to face interaction with a vendor would provide a solution or atleast a service of the product, which now is not possible as Amazon wouldn’t take back its product nor do they provide service of the product purchased beyond their return period)",1
"1. Packaging is good.. 2. Got a brush to clean, charger, and a pouch.. 3. Easy to clean.. 4. My previous trimmer was also a philips product and it was good. Now after 5 years, the battery life is diminishing. So I have a good feeling about this.. 5. I will review this again after 6 months.",5
"i really liked the product. only point here is that if you want to a mild trim of long beard, keep the settins at 6+. if you keep 3/4, then it will give you a nearly clean shaven look. but overall its a fantastic product with multifunctional options",5
"Works flawlessly. Thanks to amazon for fast delivery and the packaging was great . You will get trimmer , a pouch to hold it , a brush and a Philips 7.5 w charger . Product doesn't heat up after using continuously for 5 mins. Battery is really good , will last very long after a charge. Go for it. Will update if any issue arises in near future.",5
"Finally here's a product that matches with the product description, which is usually not the case with . The Philips Q T 40 11 is a smooth and well-designed for a smooth operation. Probably the annoying factor is the noise the Philips trimmer creates. Paper packing of the product is excellent, except the thick plastic by Amazon. This is a serious harm that wr cause to our environment.. I request Amazon.in to withdraw from using plastic for the sake our planet.",4
"The best at this price range. The trimmer settings are 1 to 10, 1 for very short and 10 for longer trims. Make sure not to clean it under water as it's not water proof. However, the cutting head is detachable and can be cleaned after removing. Overall, a very good buy for those who trim their beard regularly",5
"amazon is cheating customer, Selling Nova Trimmers in the name of Phillips.. Woow",1
"The trimmer worked pretty well for an year, and the rotator cap came off so contacted the customer care.. Surprising they only have 2 service centers in hyderabad. Who would spend travelling 10 kms for a small repair, so if you are buying it based on the warranty they've shown, DON'T BUY IT.",1
"Bought this product in November,2016 for Rs.1569. Now, it's around 3 years and still it works like a charm. I have to charge the product only once in a month.. Liked this product very much. As the blades are titanium metal it never gets rusty.. Philips has kept up its brand quality through this product.",5
"Battery is good. However, with time the trimming blades doesn't work properly maybe because of the motor which loses its power, then you have to plug the trimmer to power outlet to get more power, could be a battery issue. I am talking of after 1.5 year.",4
"I am typing this review after using it for about 3 years now. Now I can say the price has been hiked. Performance wise there is no issue at all. Charging time within 1 hr. That's amazing. Battery life - I charge it within 1 month or sometimes 1 month and a half as I use it every week. Go for it. No problems at all since 3 years.. One con is there, it doesn't trim that accurately. for some areas on the face, I have to do it 2-3 times to trim the hair.",4
Awesome trimmer. It can be used not only as beard trimmer but also to trim body hair on chest or those on your head. Just be careful that you don't place it neatly when traveling as the plastic comb head may break and there seems to be no replacement available. The trimmer though.. real good deal!,5
the trimmer works really good. blades are sharp and its skin friendly. has many length settings. helps to style. saves time. saves money. its rechargeable so no chords while using. you can use freely anytime anywhere without any power plugs and all. battery life is very nice. doesn't make that much noise. its travel friendly as well. so overall a great product,5
"I am writing this review after 4 years of usage. my usage was very less. only usage for me is trimming moustache without comb. it went well for 4 years. Main drawback for this trimmer is battery is non-replaceable. If battery is dead, you have to throw it in dustbin.",3
It is useful if you want to trim your beard completely. There is an option to trim with some level but it is not working as expected and not working if you have lot of beard. I can only use it when i need to trim all beard and can not use if if i want to keep some level of beard.. Over all battery life is good.,2
I am giving it two star cos of the blade .the blade is big and wide .and not very precise . Thats why the the length setting comb is usless .ok now the battery is very good .fast charging .only one hour and it Will give you enough time .but end of the day we are after a good quality trimmer .and its jus ok .some cheaper trimmers are better than this model .so one star for cutting part and 4star for battery .hope this will help you,2
"Have been using it for few months now, charging speed and batter life are very good. Trimming quality is superb 👍 I recommend this solid trimmer. Easy to use, fast charge, good battery life and solid trimming",5
"This device will watch your back always.... I mean beard !. It is the quickest and cleanest form of getting a trim.. With intervals of trimming options at every 0.5 steps starting from 0.5 being the lightest then moving on to 1, 1,5, 2, 2,5. You can now avoid looking like a child after a shave",4
It's working very good... genius product...long lasting but I lost its charger and I have to go Delhi to purchase a new one.and charger cost me Rs.500 that's 1/3rd of the price of product itself.....and another problem is that it took too much time to clean it after trimming and the hairs spread all over the body .. otherwise a good product,4
Charges for 1 hour and provides ~ 10 times usage. (Each usage being 10 minutes). Comes with only 1 accessory for trimmer.. Medium noise and is good for daily use.. Easy to clean.. Charger blinks during charge and will stop blinking after completely charged.,4
"Very handy, easy to use, easy to clean, with good battery life. My brother in law has been using this since 2016 and its still working fine - no issues at all. I bought it recently and it still has the same quality! Highly recommended.",5
"It purchased it 4 years ago, it worked perfectly almost 4 years now its battery and motors rotation on blade stopped working.. Worth to purchase it, paisa vasool product.. It would be better if someone can help me with how to repair the blade because the motor is working fine.",4
Really nice quality. Battery life is too good..sometime when in hurry and there is no battery left it takes hardly a few minutes to charge for a single use... Cleaning is a bit tricky at times but if cleaned on a regular basis it's very easy. Last but not the least it's very very easy to use and safe to use at the same time. One can go for any beard style with ease.. Time saving quality product.,5
"This trimmer is the most basic one from Philips.. It is inexpensive, easy to use and maintain.. The only problem is that the top part which is detachable one is pretty delicate and once that breaks then this can only be used at one level.. This detachable part could have been made a bit stronger.. However at this price point this is a pretty goo trimmer.",4
"Although Philips is a good brand & I have always trusted it for the trimmers, this trimmer is cheaper than my previous trimmer which I had bought somewhere around 13k, had 6 combs & different speeds. This product feels very rough on the face & leaves the skin totally dry. Doesn't trim properly unless we push hard on the surface. I would suggest to invest more & buy better trimmer but from Philips only",2
"I have been using this product for more than 3 years and I am very much satisfied with it. It is working great and didn't give any problem till now. This give very clean trim and product quality is also very good. Price is on lil bit higher side but I have also used the Xiaomi's trimmer, without any doubt Phillips trimmer is a clear winner.",4
"I will write only about the disadvantage:-. The main function of a trimmer is TRIMMING and it doesn't work properly.. If you set the trimmer to 2 or 3, the trimming is not evenly done. Some areas get over-trimmed and some areas remain untouched. So, I am not with the product.",3
"This Philips QT4011 trimmer which I purchased recently is very handy to use. It's long lasting battery life of 90 minutes was the best thing I liked about it as you don't have to keep on charging in between your trimming sessions. It has 20 different length settings which you can adjust accordingly suiting your desired look. The trimming was fine and even on all sides and is very convenient to use .Also , the blades are user friendly so it won't leave a cut on your skin. After the trimming session , it's very easy to clean it with the brush provided with the product.. Overall had a great experience.",5
I have been using it for past one and hLf years. Saved around 1000 rupees which I would have otherwise spent in the saloon.. I started using it during my marriage hunt. I needed to trim breard every week. But going going to barber was expensive as well as time consuming. Before I bought it I used to clean shave as trimming on my own was near impossible. The neat trimmed look this trimmer gives is impressive,5
1. When this charging time less than 15 to 30min. Usage time comes 1 hour or more so it's a good battery life. 2. It's a very easy to use because it's a simple to carry and trimming. 3. This device easy to clean because this device is full closed model and this device boxs contains a small brush also. 4. Last but not least it's worthable product at this price,5
"Been using it for more than month. I feel satisfied at last after using few other trimmers in the last years. 0.5mm precision trimming is damn accurate. It is light weight, easy to carry for travel, battery lasts for long time (I've charged it only once so far), safety feature and built solid. Thank you Philips for this well designed product at a reasonable price.",5
Good product.. Best battery backup.. Best blades among ranges available in market.. Its motor shaft and blade's connection mechanism is magnetic which fails after some uses.. My trimmer is now of no use because of this problem. It fails to trim.. Not Recommended.. Buy corded one instead.,4
Very tough Trimmer till Date. I have been using this since 4 years still it work's flawlessly. I don't have any complaint about anything.. Just go for it.. Battery life is good you can trim up your beard 5-6 times in single charge.,5
"Works perfectly fine like day 1, excellent build quality and good battery back up and also we can use it with the power cord connected, titanium blades really lasts long, its almost 3 years and still works perfextly for me, ergonomics is very good.",5
"Style your beard the way you want with this beard trimmer. Precision from as short as 0.5mm up to 10mm. Get a perfect yet protective trim, time after time. a perfect stubble, just 0.5mm long. Easy to select and lock-in length settings, 0.5mm to 10mm. ... The trimmer's titanium blades lightly brush against one another, sharpening themselves as they trim so they stay extra sharp and effective as on .",5
"Good one to trim beard, not for the scalp hair. Buy a hair clipper for that. Good battery life, sharp blades, be careful while dealing with moustache, can hurt lips of not careful. Provided brush s sufficient to clean it. Better to clean with every trim.",4
One of the best entry level trimmers. Can be used both with and without electricity. Battery back up of fully charged trimmer is excellent. Good value for money. Goes easy on skin too.,4
"charge for 1 hour and it can be used for almost 90 minutes , that will be 1.5 hours, tested twice , battery life is good,",4
"I'm making this review after 3 months of use.. The product is well packed and a big thanks goes 2 Amazon,. Built quality is good,. Battery is long lasting , it took approx 90 mins to get fully charged and it lasts for me at least for 5 times trimming.. I highly recommend this product .. I also use it for my chest hair trimming and it gives me finest trimming results....",5
"its a cool product well built and having a good battery, nothing much can be written about the machine more than that, it perform the given task well.. i was using a lower model of philips trimmer and it looks and feel the same as its predecessors, things which are improved is its battery life and a very important option of using the trimmer on charge, means you can plug it and use it if its not charged, it was a feature which was missing in my previous philips trimmer.. Its not a timmer its a necessary accessory for the modern man.",4
"Excellent product from Phillips. At first i was hesitating from buying this trimmer, but finally i decided to buy it. Delivery super fast. Ordered on 9th jan 2018. And recieved it on 10th of jan 2018 i.e. the next day. Charging and backup is same as mentioned. Product build is very good. Not very heavy.",5
After using 4 months I'm writing this review.. I purchase it for 1799 from Amazon. 1.product have 20 adjustable length settings. You can set length settings as your need for beard.. 2.it has strong battery life. After full charge you can use it for 95 minutes continue.. 3.easy to clean. Just open the front blade part by pressing and hold under stream.. 4.I am satisfied with this product. Thanks Philips for this awesome product.. 5.you can also extend your warranty period 1 year by registering on Philips.com,4
"So far so good. Made in China. Dear Amazon, please indicate country of manufacturing / origin in the online product display so that buyers can make informed decisions. I used it hence won't be able to return same unless it breaks.",4
Very easy to use of this trimmer but blade is not very sharp or great quality. The most important is it's battery backup. I used many trimmers of all branded company but this trimmer is more Great battery backup performance.,5
Worked well at the beginning. Now stops working even if you use it for 3-4 seconds. Avoid it.,1
"i replaced my old philips model with this one because the charging point on it was damaged and getting it to charge was becoming a hassle. i picked this one because of the longer battery life. and by god, it has been fantastic so far. quality of the actual trim is more or less same as the older (cheaper) model. totally worth it just for longer battery life!",4
"Nice trimmer. I had a nova trimmer earlier but that trimmer doesn't work well. Before every trim I had to charge it and it also had a poor quality motor which doesn't work smoothly. But this one is superb in quality. Only thing is that the box doesn't look good from outside, but looks good inside. Hope it will work for a long time.",4
"No product can be matched with Philips, am writing this review after using the product after almost a year, believe me it's value for your money. Best trimmer you could get for the reasonable price.",5
"Trimming experience: really good. Battery life: more than enough. ( I have been using Panasonic trimmer, which was bought from Dubai, for the past 5 years! It was perfect until it started showing some battery problems. This one works just as good )",5
The best trimmer in the market under 2000 rupees. It does more than what it actually meant to be. Gives very clean and smooth finish. Battery backup is just amazing. Have bought this on one of my friends recommendation. No regrets so far.,5
"Like this Product. I had used it today, easy to Use and easy to Clean too. I will recommend for all. Instead of Going to Barber and getting infected from Corona or any other Diseases. Buy this Product.",5
"One of the best buys i have ever had.. Great value for money, easy to use..!. The adjustable length (increments of 0.5) helps to trim at will.. I save the Rs.100/week at the saloon.. Highly recommended👍",5
"I have been using Philips products for past 10 years,. Coming to this trimmer it is a hybrid trimmer with reduced charging time & better battery back up.. Hope it lasts upto 2 years atleast.",5
"It's a great product and I'm happy with the delivery!. It has an amazing battery life. It can last upto 10 days without charging, considering 10-12 minutes of usage everyday. It's very convenient to use and it gives good results!",5
Using since 3 years and again bought for my younger brother. Nice battery backup. Blade is still sharp as 3 years back.. Must go for this product. Although its little expensive but better than other product in this price range.,5
"Product is good but packing from Philips is hopeless. Unlike other Philips products, there is no compartment in the packing(box). Trimmer and it’s accessories are all dumped into single box. Guess, since product is good Philips is confident & under the impression ‘whichever way cost cutting we do people will buy it’.",4
"Hai all, iam using this product for 15days, absolutely awesome trimmer in design, performance, color, holding in hand, look and feel, 20 length settings etc etc everything is cool. Best thing is LED indicator (while charging green light is blinking & after full charge green light stops blinking & at low battery red light will blink) coooool. Beware, if u use without the clip at the top bcz it get the chance to cut ur skin and dont use any other part of ur body (haha,, u know what i mean). Make sure u find the right port to charge bcz most of the plugs are in loose contact with the charger (However, LED will tell u whether it is in charge or not). Also make sure u register in philips website to get an extra 1yr warranty after purchase....so, stop reading reviews on this product and dont waste ur time...............LIKE i said JUST GO FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Biggggggg Thumbs up to amazon and philips :)",5
"Hi,. In case of blade not performed well after sometime, where can i buy the blades?. where will i go, if repair?. earlier i used the same for 2 years after that blades not performed well, hence i through it out.. Please reply to buy new one again as the performance is excellent.",4
"The upper red extension part is very fragile.. Use carefully if the trimmer falls, it's the first one to broke.. Could be great if detaching & cleaning are improved.",3
I am happy that I invested in this product m working fine till date and solved my problem of using local trimmer that go down the hill every three months one time investment and You're sorted for the longest time.. Edit 1: 3 years and it is still working fine. the battery has become weak but blades are intact.,5
"I am using it for more than 3 years, battery still give way more backup than i need. Phillips service is also great, though it stopped working once and i had it to service centre and they repaired it since then its been functioning nicely.",5
"Battery is good. But what I don't like is the fragile material,. When you go for a brand you expect a longer and a decent product but this fails to deliver that level.",3
Worked well for 6 months with only 5 charges. Charging is not going in.. dont know why.. Warranty details not available for this product in the app. But all the grooming products have atleast 2 years warranty.,3
I purchased this product on Oct 2016 and am writing the review on June 2019.. This really is a indication of the well built quality of the trimmer. The blades are functional even now.. This is simply my Best purchase.. Go for it with your eyes closed.,5
"The Product was good.. Why because My brother was already using it from 1.2 Years. Yet, it was not damaged since.. he has been using it for every 7-10 days. And no problem came when I used it more than 7 times.. It was cutting every small beard hair, Thanks for its Gold coated Plate.. Main thing was, If you charge it for just 30-35 minutes You can use 90 Minutes continuously.. Only this model has that much performance, not any other models in PHILIPS.. I will recommend this from my Side for Buying.",5
"Good item has very good sharp cutting blade at the same time it's quite safe to use , good brand as well my last trimmer was also Philips which lasted almost 5 years , but recently it broke due to a accidental fall",5
"Yes! This thing is stronger than you think. I wasn't sure using it on my 2 months long hair during quarantine, but trust me, the result was amazing (please do not use it wirelessly if you're trimming your hair). Battery life is amazing. This trimmer IS DURABLE!",5
This product from Philips is so sturdy and nicely built in a small size. The blades are powerful enough. Battery backup is also very good. Inbuilt cutting size changer is a plus point. Price is also good. I would definitely recommend to buy this product.,4
"Well every guy needs this product, good battery life, get charge shortly.. Easy to use without cut.. Clippers and blade can be cleaned easily.. I bought it in 2016 and still working,. In 2019, had some fault, and it was under warrantly, so after finding the fault they sent me a new piece. Their service is also so good.. GO FOR IT.",5
Wow!!!! The product feels and looks amazing. Very happy to receive this product. As promised my Amazon got the delivery on 3rd May. Very essential during lockdown and for person hygiene. Very happy !!!!,5
"2 star for use, reason is the size adjuster. When I keep it on 1.5 or 2 mm and use it to trim moustache, but the height adjuster is not fully covered on the blade edge rather it is open for about 3mm width. So when we turn hands or the direction it almost cuts to 0.5 mm at places, and it becomes annoying. So stopped using it at all.",3
"Ordering it for the 2nd time, the 1st one lasted 4 years.. Its good machine, good battery life and charges fast, but doesn't trim short like some other machines but its so good overall ...",5
"It is perfect and genuine product. I used it four times , looks all good till now. Everything as it is described in product details on amazon. I would have been given 5 star but one star short is all about charging performance. While charging , it becomes hot. Though, this is not affecting its performance, so it is worth to buying this product.",4
"Just received the product,delivery time is good(6daysfor COD),when I open the package box seems to be bit damaged,it was crushed in several places,and the inner product tray is just average like Chinese products,not seems like a branded one,I thought box n tray will at good quality,but just average.finally product looks good,as of now working fine, I will update my review after few days with the performance of the trimmer.. Thankyou",3
"Purchased it on 21-01-2017 , Updating my review in Jan. 2020..... Battery life- only works for 2 minutes even after full charge. Now I have to use it plugged in.. Blade/Motor connector issue:- Trimmer's blade suddenly stops moving. Hair trapped in between blades. Hard to complete my beard trimming due to above issue.. Customer Support & Warranty- Very poor. They denied for my location service and free service due to the reason that I have complained on 25-01-2020(5 Days before if date of delivery is taken for warranty) and not between the date of purchase and 3 years warranty(21-01-2017 to 21-01-2020) Although I got product in my hand by amazon on 30-01-2017(Date Of Delivery &Date of Registration on philips website for 1 year extented warranty , total 3 years warranty).. How can one count warranty from date of purchase instead counting from date of delivery or registeration In Online Purchase??. Warranty should start when product is in customer's hand...... They or I should say every online e commerce companies have to change this. What is the benefit of 3 year warranty when you can't count it in proper way(When customer gets the product in hands , Date of Delivery) ??. Moreover Blade repair is not free under warranty!. Service Charges - So they said that I have to pay 118₹(100₹+18%GST) for Store Service and 177₹(150₹+18%GST) for Home Service. Blade and Battery Replacement Charges would cost you around 800-1000₹. Better to buy a new trimmer of different brand like MI trimmer.. I am regretting my decision now due to warranty date issue and money spent on it. Although it costed me 1400₹(1649₹ deal price - 15% sbi card discount) But generally it costs around 1700-1800₹ So not worth the money overall...... Not expected this behaviour from Company like philips regarding warranty date issue.... SAVE YOUR MONEY!!. Better to buy mi or other value for money budget trimmers.",1
Awesome for beard and head.. Will definitely NOT recommend it for body hair removal. I used it for removing hairs on my chest and back and got many cuts on body. But overall for beard it's really awesome. Long lasting battery and precise cutting.,5
Nice product @1400 I have purchased on offer of 200 gift card.. After using three times here are my points. I have charged only once till now and it gives three times perfect shave battery is good. previously I was using same brand Philips QT4001/15 but it was getting hot (blade) so it was not face friendly. but this have awesome blade with no heating problem I love it. and thanks to Amazon for delivery and packaging,5
This is the third of the same product I'm buying and not because the previous one broke down but they literally broke. I mean they just go on and on and on. Fast charge even better.,5
Go for it. Best in the price. Insane battery life. Other trimmers give 45 mins usage for 10 hours of charge. That's ridiculous. But this one gives 90 mins usage for just 60 mins of charge. That reason alone should be enough to buy it. Also warranty can be extended upto 3 years by registering it on philips website.,5
"Writing the review after about 2 years of purchase. Why would anyone write a review after 2 years? Only if its too good or too bad. In my case, its the former. The trimmer is worth every single penny. There's literally no con. Everything about it is great.",5
"I am a fan of Philips Trimmmer from last 7 Years and this is my 2nd trimmer, one thing I am happy that I still use the one which I bought 7 years back with Chord as the battery is gone.. THis is a great piece for this price as it works both with power Chord and with out. even your battery is drained or gone bad you could use this piece until the motor or blade stops.. Kudos to Amazon the way it is delivered and for the pack !!!",5
"After 12 months of usage the motor inside comes of and blades doesn't move, after every 30-40secs of use blade falls off and I have to re-engage motor in its position. Last time I used Phillips for 3 years before blades went blunt. This time not satisfied.",2
"This is the excellent trimmer I have come across. With Philips brand, you don't have to worry about quality and warranty. Battery life is great, precision is very good, easy to remove blade and clean it. Long charging wire allow convenient use while plugged in as well. Don't worry for price, go for it!",5
"This version is the best. It charges very quickly. Also you can use it while charging. There is smart lights to indicate - charging , battery full,battery low etc .. Easy to clean and use. Go for it.",4
"Pros - Charging time is very good, you don't have to wait hours to use it.. Usage time is more than an hour so you can use it many times on one charge.. Easy to clean and easy to use.. Cons - The charger quality, although not bad, but can be improved.. So yeah, you can put 500 more on other trimmer of this series and this will save your lots of time.",5
"Thank You Amazon,. For the Superfast Delievry.. I Ordered it on 5th Oct and got the product on 7th.. Though My Area is Not so good in terms of Coverage Normally every other E-Commerce Giant Usually take 5-7 Days and some even 10-12 Days.. I am very delighted to get the product In 2 Days.. And About The product it is Amazing. The Battery Life is Superb, I Used it for continous 45-50 odd min and the product keeps on working amazingly Without any heat issues at all.. Overall Very Much Satisfied.. for Superfast Delievry [in my specific pin code] 10/10. For product 9/10",5
perfect. awesome product. you can trim all the hairs on body without hurting yourself. usually I spend my time clearing my hairs when I don't have anything to do. it's a great time pass.. I think you all must try it.,5
"It is good product with minimizing the hair length as can be done by trimmer, however clean shave is not done as it can be done only by razor.It has one problem of spreading the trimmed hair which can be corrected in the higher version with vaccum collection system.",4
Nice product. Good battery life and very less charging time. I got additional 1 year online warranty so it is nice. But kinda noisy. It always let my neighbors know I'm trimming. But still a nice purchase. If you can spend Rs 300 more you can get a shaver cum trimmer of Philips. I already have Philips shaver so this one completed my set.. I know it is off topic but I have Philips tape recorder from year 1990 which still works. That's why I trust Philips. They make good stuff.,5
Battery life is the best. Full charge lasts for more than two weeks. Can anyone beat that?. Ultra sharp blades for a clean shave and trimming experience.. Precision’s on a 20 scale (10cm though). Go for it! You will love your decision!,5
I am very disappointed with the lifecycle of this blade is very less .Within 2 years I will use this trimmer maximum 20-25 times and it's blade is not working properly and the 2'nd thing is about it cost is also too much Rs.700 .,2
Have been using this for almost 3-4 years now. Best budget trimmer. Does the job perfectly. No irritating noise. Easy to clean. Battery lasts for 4 to 5 trims. Simple to use. highly recommended for first time trimmer users.,5
This trimmer is good for long life compare to mi trimmer it's better for use having platinum type blade is good battery back up too good and also its shape is good to use easily..and also having one cleaner it's easy to clean to but one thing don't wash using water....coz they didnt mention to use water ... otherwise it's too good ..having two year warranty and plus one year for online purchase . ..,5
I had bought this trimmer when I was in 11th now I am in 3rd year engineering and this still works fine have dropped it 4-5 times no damage at all really value for money and wired use is what makes it awesome if the charging is down you just need to plug and the wire is long enough to trim beard with comfort. even after 5 years it is working great so don't think just buy it.,5
"I've been using this for the past 1 year and this January 2021, one year had passed but unfortunately when I plugged it in yesterday, it ended up charging but not working at all, I guess the battery has gone out, the battery lasted for a long time and I hadn't charged it at all for more than 4 months because I rarely used it but now when I need it it doesn't work",3
"Bought this for my husband. According to him, it's a good deal considering they have titanium-coated blades that self sharpen with many length settings. He used this to trim his beard and found it easy to handle.",5
"Amazing trimming beard product!!! Battery life is is amazing it works for more than 90 mins... easy to clean, length attachment is sturdy and help to get desirable beard length.",4
It’s an easy to handle design trimmer. With the blades sharp and doing a great job. The charging indicator somehow doesn’t show the green light when it’s charged. Over all it’s a comfortable trimming experience with this trimmer.. On the downside the final beard level doesn’t seem to match the description. I certainly recommend this product.,4
"Even I charge its battery after finishing my trim, I found its batter drained when I use it next time !!!!!. Its CAM rotor is loosing its contact with the blade, so you have to open the blade and required to reassemble to get it work properly, Its blade are aslo hurting the skin.",2
"I have used it 4 times since i got it and its been really good. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Yes the red part and the removable blade part feels a little like cheap plastic, but as long as it gets the job done i am happy. Its been just a month, and if i encounter any problems with it i shall update my review.",5
"Writing this review after 1 year usage. I was using a different Philips model for more than 3 years. Brought this one for closure trim especially 0.5 mm. This was close enough during few months. After 4 to 6 months,the close trim of 0.5mm is gone. Not recommending for those looking for 0.5 mm trim. Battery life is good. Getting upto 7 trims with one recharge.",2
This is a second time i am goin for a philips trimmer..the last one i used for last 8 years.. this trimmer is also a very good product..easy to use..excellent battery life..provides a easy and good trim,5
"Very Good Product and very professional built quality, but I feel it's Little overpriced! If you get it for anything less than 1850 buy it blindly",4
"It's nifty, portable, the battery lasts a LONG time, and it gets the job done.. Never had any cuts, bruises or other issues with this.. I've owned this since 2016. Nothing's happened to it.. Cheers to a great product! Thanks to Amazon for fulfilling the delivery promptly.",5
After a year there was problem in its functioning.. The motor was working but the head was not. So i searched online for solution and stick the blade with the motor with feviquick.. It helped.. Its work g fabulously now..,4
BEST QUALITY AND SERVICE AT THIS PRICE RANGE.. DOESN'T EVEN CHARGED EVEN A SINGLE TIME SINCE 3 MONTHS AFTER ITS DELIVERY.. IT IS WORKING WITH THE CHARGE THAT COMPANY HAS PROVIDED.. BEST BATTERY BACKUP.. THIS TRIMMER IS VERY POWERFUL. IT TRIMS THE BEARD VERY FAST.,5
"Arey Bhai. Kharid Le. Office, Date, Marriage Function, Birthday Celebration aur bhi itne saare fucntions aur ceremony ke time pe jaisi beard aur look chahiye milega. Best hai Bhai. Battery life ek dam awesome. Bindass buy Kar. Use Karne ke baad pahle hot water me blade ko rakh ke saaf Kar then cotton cloth se sukha de. Bahut chalega. Aur time to time after every 3rd shave battery charge Kar.",5
"Bought it for 1349 in lightening deals, the body is quite sturdy and ergonomical. Charging is pretty fast and that's one reason of spending a Lil more than qt4007/6. There are some design flaws towards the trimmer blade, where small hairs gets stuck on the extreme edges of the blade between edges and the body.. But good thing is the powerful motor and perfectly sharp blades. Trims like knife through soft butter.. Speed adjustment is a missing feature, though not a feature required for day to day.",5
Been using for a month now without any issues. Too early to confirm on the life but other things like cleaning and all are easy.. One thing to remember while using - higher the number - longer the hair that remain on your head (not the ones that are cut :D ),5
"Great product, MRP 2400 everywhere but got in 1799 in amazon sale. Used it for hair trimming, results are very good. overall very good product, even recommended for haircut at home. Product update. Flimsy comb attachment broke in exact 3 usage",5
This product is awesome at this price ... Charging is good.... Product material is good... And it's a genuine product... But some times it cut the skin when accidentally trimmer contact direct with the skin.... But it's blade quality is superb....,5
"This is the best trimmer model from philips. trimmer and charger both are light weight. Unlike other models, this can charge full in an hour, and charging indication is there. But after warranty period it'll be a nightmare, it'll be like a disposable product. My trimmer's battery got damaged after warranty period. I've visited 2 service centers of Philips in Bangalore. They told they can't repair it, If it's under warranty period they would've replace it.",4
Compare to other Trimmers it is best in simple Trimmer Category.. Recharges quickly and Backup is good.. If you are always in hurry or travel lot and don't want to Charge for long time than Just go for it.. Pros- Handy and Easy to clean. Small size.. I had bought it for Rs1500 an year ago. writing this review after using it for 1 year.. If u want simple Trimmer with good battery backup than don't think buy it.,5
All same stories:. - Doubted first; I am not sure about Philips; Performance?. But Philips QT4011/15 does a great job in terms of any Men beard requirement - (bought on deal~1700₹). Need to see Longevity!!... Good Buy...!!,5
I loved the product... Pros. Can give different shape to your shave. Easy to use. If you use daily battery will last for 15-20days. If dont like shave nd want to give shape to your beard than buy this,5
Must have trimmer at home. Works very well for hair cut and beard trimmer. 1 star less for in-effective beard and bad battery life (as per what they quote).,4
"Adjustable adapter is not good design, hair got stuck inside adapter. I bought due to Amazon nothing else.. Now I understand that should not buy the products because of reviews only",3
"The charger was great at its work ,charging remained for decades ,i just charged it once after i got it i used it for month ,buy if you are searching for good trimmer , as its phillips need not talk about quality 👌🏼,thank you amazon for extraordinary delivery packing and genuine product",5
Great trimmer! Battery lasts long too. It does get a little warm but that doesn’t affect its usage. There are only a few parts to remove and clean. Very easy to maintain and use for long!,5
"Lack of additional attachment makes it hard to deal with my beard and mustache since my hair texture is not same like other men, so even when i want to trim my beard it just don't cut properly and i end up doing a clean shave 😐",3
"After 6 months usage, It still stands for 40 - 50 mins for 1 hour charging. Comes with 2 years warranty so that we can go for this product. 0.5 mm precision trimming is another advantage at this price. So many good trimmers are available for this price and give good output. Only because of warranty coverage and service centre availability. I am preferring this.",4
"Great product. Easy to use. Lonh battery life quick charge in 1 hr only. Lasts very long. Cleaning is also easy. 6 months ago, it fell in water, dried it in sunlight. Checked after 2 days, its still working well.",5
"Trimmer is good, serves the purpose, only thing lacking is the missing how to use guide in the package. It might take a while for one to get adjusted to it's settings and how to use it.",5
"Using from last 1 month.. And it works good as expected.. :). Update: (20April 2019). This Trimmer works like charm.. No charging issue.. Superb Build Quality.. Nice Grip on hand.. Blades are still safe without any damage.. You can trim more than 8-9 times with a single charge. 1 times charge takes merely 1hour. So go ahead guys, if ure are looking for .5 Trimmer.. Update: (25 July 2019). Battery & Blades are superb. Roller(Setting controller) still working fine. No cons at all.",5
"I have already used kemei trimmer which costs around 250rs. But this one is perfect. I can't say about battery backup as i used only twice. This one has corded use option. Its Blade cuts precisely. This philips product satisfies all the things that one can expect from a 2k trimmer.. This product comes with 2 year warranty. But you can get additional one year by registering in philips products site.. The only problem is, its spare parts costs heavier.",4
The red trim cover which moves and adjusts the height has big play in it. It bends and that brings variation in the length of the beard if you apply varying pressure throughout your trim. If you constantly apply maximum pressure then it gives proper size of beard.. This is the only drawback of this. Otherwise it is a good quality product.,3
"Philips Trimmer one of the best trimmer I had so far.. Reviews are written with five months experience. Pros:. 1) Easy to use. 2) Easy to clean. 3) Blades are so good. 4) Charge last so long more than five to six trims.. 5) Come as Handy, you can easily move it your entire face in any direction. Cons:. 1) So tiny cant be trim you neeed to use scissors.. Still thinking to buy?, just buy and experience yourself.",4
"Works exactly as mentioned in the specs. quick charging (1hr) results in 90 mins run time. Absolutely no irritation to the skin when used without the red cap. Red cap adjusts itself when you scroll the knob for length adjustment. cleaning is super easy, just flip open the blade and clean with a brush (or under the tap - for the blade only). smooth ergonomic grip. not too noisy, no need of oil or other maintenance stuff. Love it!",5
Philips Quality has gone to ZERO for the past 1 decade.. if the beard had grown up and this product doesn't work at all with the numbers 3 or 4. only 1 works.,2
"well , its been 1 year since am using this product ,just saw feedback list so here i am. this product is amazing. best thing about this product is its battery life. i don't trim daily so i charge it once and can use for 1 to 2 months (once in a week i trim). Easy to use, if you are not able to use first time then don't worry guys you will learn after 2 or 3 times. i even trimmed 3 months beard to size 0 (size controller removed) as it is difficult to shave with long beard so it is advised to trim it first and then clean shave. well if you have this ,you won't be doing clean shave ever. :)",5
"Nice product from Philips. Charge once and go on trimming. Setting to adjust the trimmer ranges from 1 to 10. Shorter the selection, finer the trimming. Vibration and noise isn't that much but still expected it to be more silent. No extra clips provided. While charge is about to run out, reddish orange light is flikker. Could be used while on charging. Overall a nice trimmer to have.",4
I would give 5 star for this product if i did not use the previous version of this. Where i got and almost many got the issue that connection from motor and spinning gaudge was often getting disconnected and the trimmer stops working. I believe this is also designed the same way so i would expect it to happen later. Otherwise this product is the best of all with 1 hour charging which provides you an hour cordless trim. And you can use by connecting as well. Battery indicator is given newly. Enhanced exterior build quality. And the trimming starts from 0.5mm. Which is great with intermediate stops till 10 mm.,4
"Firstly, Thank you Amazon. I placed order with standard shipping though the product got delivered to me in two days. Just amazing :). I purchased this product with a fair research. This is the best trimmer in the budget. Things that justify this is the best trimmer in the budget.. *This trimmer has titanium blades compared to normal blades which come with models QT4001-4006 which last usually for 2 years.. *This trimmer having a use time of 90 Minutes on a charge of 60 Minutes, Every trimmer below this model having 60 Minutes use time for 10 hours charge which is ridiculous.. Also, This trimmer has reduced in price hugely since its launch. Amazon is offering at best price than any other eCommerce.. Saving couple hundred bucks to purchase this compared to any lower models in phillips is totally worth every penny and time.",5
"It simply stopped working after 10mons. There is an orange light blinking.. I wonder if I can claim warranty. Any help with that, anybody? I live in Chennai.",1
"*Fast charging. * For a single trim, you just need to charge it for 10 minutes.. *Battery backup is awesome. * Build quality is superb. * Charging cable is also very good. * 1+1 year extra warranty from Philips!. Overall experience with this product is superb. Charge it once and it will work for around 3,4, trimmings.",5
The trimmer is the best of choice after a long research & finding.. Hope this review helps you save time & satisfy your requirement. Priced 1699/- when I purchased and the best of features basically required is met.. Used it 3 times now and good product delivery & service. Thank you Philips and Amazon,4
I noticed blade is heating after 5 min of use.. But its obvious as the machine is very powerful and speedy.... But after attaching attachment u will feel 0 heat.. Just with blade u might feel it,4
Doesn't grow much of beard to trim everyday... So usage is only once a week. Does a good job. Battery is the best. Did use upto five times(10-15min) in one charge... But as all battery devices needs to.. charged every week to get extended life. Fashing the good. Cleaning device great. Holding... Has and feels confident.. good grip. Operation... Simple. Battery indicators... Best. All in all... Value for money guaranteed.,5
"Feature 3/5. Battery 5/5. Quality 4/5. Standard trimmer, its not a styler. It deliver what it advertises.. Charge fast and trim well.. Impressed with minimaliatic packaging.",5
"I've had Philip products for more than 10 years, in my opinion their product work because of their quality and durability.. I bought this trimmer to replace my old Phillips trimmer (2+years)... My first impression was skeptical, as plastic body felt like cheap replacement when compared to smooth finish of my old trimmer... Then again trimmer works, hopefully for 2+ years (finger crossed)... #optimistic. My recommendation is buy👍",5
I thought it's going to make my life easy. But I rarely use it as it won't give a clean shave or close to it. The blades are meant to trim the bear not to completely take it off. I'm disappointed for sure.,3
"I bought this product based on review from other buyer and bearing in mind that this has been shown as one of the best and one of the recent release by Philips in India under the range of beard trimmers - I must say that I am not disappointed. The product came in a standard sealed packing of Philips topped up with the super box packing by Amazon to ensure there are no damages caused to the product in transit. The product is easy to use, easy to operate and do its work very well, provided you know how to use it!! Easy to clean and maintain, I highly recommend this product basis my personal experience.",5
"Works flawlessly.. I love the fact that you can choose between so many lengths freely and even in between numbers, like a half value, for e.g., 6.5 or 7.5. It is that precise.. Best part about it is that you can use it while it's plugged in. For a person like me who is always in a hurry and forgets to put it on charge before-hand, it's a very nifty feature and a much required one. That won it over for me, and it's does what it's meant to perfectly, so why pay more for a product?",5
"Normally I don't like to review any product but at the same time I read all the reviews before purchasing any product from any online websites, so I decided to write reviews for each new product that I purchased.. My view on Phillips Trimmer:. While on the first try, this trimmer works like a charm. It trims too good. I'd be expert in second try. I found it useful at all. I'm satisfied with the first try. I would update the review after charging and using it for a month.. thanks",5
"Good product from philips, the blade are very sharp.. Please be careful while using it.. Trimmer motor is very powerful... The main advantage of this product is that it charges very fast only 40 to 50 min to full charge another advantage is that it gives 3 yrs warranty... I purchase it for rs. 1698 out of which 10% is refunded in my amazon pay.. That is i pay rs 1529 for this product..",5
Close to clean shave experience. Keep in mind to lube the vibration tip and plastic holding the blade with mild grease for smooth operation and long life. As for the trimmings 100% guarantee of the prescribed length settings to match length of beard ie 0.5 mm is 0.5 mm. Best to carry during travel,5
It's a excellent product. Very easy to use no hurting best one ever .Al should try it battery life is well than expected .I experienced very bad product previously from Philips I think 2 years ago so I hesitated to buy this. But anyhow I just believed al reviews and just bought I would surprised this time they made a very good product .you should go for it .,4
Battery is lasting long enough and serves the purpose . The quality is good and worth the buy . In no time it charges and responds well to the various mm sizes and can be easily maintained and cleaned. Just never drop it and even with splashes of water it performs well,5
Very light weight and easy to use and handle and can carry easily... Doest take much space.... Battery standby time is gud.... Very safe.. No cuts observed after using... Long wire is helpful.. . I would recommend to buy this one with eyes closed... Another gud product from Amazon.. Thanks Amazon,5
"Philips QT4011/15 Trimmer, I using this product some months, Philips Trimmer performing well, and quality is well.. it has good battery backup and it has a 20 points of comb.. you can trim as you like, I suggested this trimmer to my friends.",5
"Charge lasts long enough. I have never run out of charge since I bought this on November 2018. I bought this after reading a lot of reviews and this one works fine for me. Serves the purpose, go for it. I use it for trimming my body hair. Painful to trim under crotch.",5
motor sounds a lot its irritating but its ok but blade of the phillips looks cheap when i took the blade out its to thin looks like cant use for grown beard it is useful for daily use for people who doesnt grow much hairs it takes 2-3 turns to completely clean the hairs on moustache and beard ... my panasonic er 2031 was much better than this infact 10 times better than this after using this feeling disappointed,2
"Amazing battery back up and sharp cutting profile.. no words to say the battery performance, super. The titanium coated blades have good cutting edges and rust resistive.. Handling is also very good...",5
"Super product friends.. trust me. I have use trimmer of many companys.. the very common problem which i found in them all is that, it will take 10-12 hours to charge them. But this philips QT/4011/15, with plug in for 10 mints you can use it for half an hour for sure. Very smooth in skin and sharp blade. Overall very good product in this price range. Quality is also very good. and ya.. forget to tell you it very easy to wash.",5
I like this trimmer because it has. 1. Very light weight. 2. Very long battery life. 3. Charges pretty fast and you can use it while charging. 4. 3 years of warranty. 5. Blades are sharp and skin friendly. 6 . Proper comb settings,5
"Product is excellent when used at zero setting ie. without attachment. But when used with attachment, the comb does not lift up the hair as supposed to. as a result need to do multiple strokes for trimming, would suggest only if need to do zero cut otherwise not satisfactory.",3
its been a year since i have been using this trimmer and i must say philips so far is the best brand ive come across.. the battery lasts longer than i expected with just an hour of charging. sometimes the hair gets stuck beneath the blade but can be cleaned with the brush which is given. the only problem is that you have to be very very careful using this while trimming private parts of the body it can cause some trouble...,4
As expected Good quality product..... Blade rotator get sometimes detached.... But i think its a manufacturing defect in my product only,5
"I am rewriting review after using around 9 months, I used to use another trimmer from another company. Before buying this product I have read many positive reviews of this product. I thought this trimmer going to be awesome, after using this product I surprised. Those people who gave very positive review of this product didn't used any other trimmer before, that's why they couldn't differentiate between good and bad. It is good product but if you compare with price not so good.",3
I must say this is the best trimmer i have used till now. Best thing about this trimmer is safety and battery life. It is so safe that you can use it in a sleep without getting cuts or some sort of injury and battery life is just godly you can go for entire month with just one full charge.,5
"It does what is stated, nice product, even though it doesn't give zero shave, the ability to trim is extremely good and accurate. If you are looking for quality trimmer, go for it.",4
"It's worth the money spent!! In this model, with a single charge, you can minimum get 4-5 use... easy to use... Worth it!!. Genuine advise - don't go for cheaper models of even Philips... They don't provide u good battery life.... u ll regret if u buy them....",5
Battery life trimming is great but the problem is that comb is not that consistent with trimming without the comb is just great. Easy to use with or without cord when you don't have the battery,4
"Registering my product from 2 hrs facing so much difficulties after logging in . They sent mail and when you gonna click on that mail again it says mail confirmation.. This is disgusting...... Lastly , I want to declare that I am giving you my mail and product no. .Please ensure that this must be registered.. Mail - sdubey0027@gmail.com. Trimmer qt 4011/15 - Philips NL 9206AD-4",4
"BATTERY LIFE - It's Good, But Not That Great As Mentioned In Description, But Yes, This Trimmer Got Charged In 50min. to 1 hr. & Gives The Battery Life Of 1Hr., Not 90mins. Not As Mentioned In Description, But Far Better As Compared To Other Trimmers Who Takes 9 Hour Of Charging & 45min. Of Battery Life.. EASY TO USE - Yes It Is. 😊. EASY TO CLEAN - Yes It Is. 😊",4
It's a good product. Easy to use -helped me a lot during covid lockdown in avoiding going to to barber shop. It takes time to understand right value to set when doing hair trimming - let to few accidents (too short hair) but now getting a hang of it. Should provide some more attachments for head hair trimming and maybe nose hair also.,4
"Very useful product. Helps me to keep my bear stylish. Takes a bit of time to get charged. But once charged, it can be used for minimum 5-6 times based on thickness of the beard. Also thanks to Amazon for fast delivery!",5
"This product is not that good. The motor doesn't have much power for thick beard. Also one more issue came with the product is that it is not properly coupled from inside, Everytime I need to fix the rotor back to the motor. I had a bad experience with the product",2
"The Trimmer is excellent for trimming beard as well as hair on the head. It is good for trimming hair on the back as well as the sides of the head. For the crown, it is to be used with caution since one has to use fingers to increase the length. A comb and scissors could be a better alternative for the crown. Very good.",4
THIS IS THE BEST THING AND LONG LASTING TRIMMER IVE EVER BOUGHT IN 2018 I HAD BOUGHT ONE WHICH LASTED TILL 2020 WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM NOW I BOUGHT THIS ONE WHICH HAVE MORE EXTRA SPECIFICATION AND YES BATTERY LIFE IS SUPERB I HARDLY HAVE TO CHARGE IT FOR MY BEARD TRIMMING (DONT USE ON UNDER ARMS),4
delivered with proper packaging. Using it for past 1-2 months. The charge remains long and quickly getting charged. It cuts hair upto 0.5 mm precision. The blades are sharp hence need to be careful as it may damage the skin.,5
Superb.. invest rupess 800 more n buy corded n cordless... Previously was using Philip cordless only.. but after 2 years batery power went down... This corded Is a trimming beast for my hair.:-),5
"Great product, works as it should.. Please note the packaging was in a simple small cardboard box with a small branding sticker. Apparently they have changed their packaging compared to what is shown on amazon as product image.. However the product is original and works great.",5
"I bought this a year ago and while considering other trimmers I found this one to be a good choice. Good, here, doesn't mean average, it's actually above average in terms of battery. Although I use it only once or twice a month, it usually needs charging after 2nd or 4th shave. Overall, this trimmer should be your choice if battery and charging is your priority.",4
The best product in its class. Good battery backup. I have bought this for the second time. Lasts for usually 2 to 2.5 years. After which the blades go bad and are not available easily.. One feedback for amazon will be if they can sell the blades for this product it would be great,3
"Best thing about this is less charging time and long battery life, i personally use this every other day cant even remember when was the last time i charged, Can give you minor cuts also it doesn't trim evenly when using the guard on settings.",4
The product looks and function appears quite decent. I was not expecting less from Philips from that. I am cutting one star that's for the plastic quality of the extended level seems quite disappointing and appears that it would break soon.,4
"After cleaning ,the grease vanishes and the blade doesn't move, thats freaking me out now.. You surely Should order a greaae bottle with it!! Ciao peace out✌",2
"Bought these as I planned to keep a beard now and not shave it completely, a razor is best for that. Decent battery life, easy to use and if the battery is over just use it with the cord.. It's easy to clean too.",5
Great product by philips.. the most amazing thing about this particular trimmer is its battery life.. gets charged pretty quickly and the backup is awesome.. servers all the basic purposes and comes with brand name that delivers.. Go for it without any second thoughts!!,5
Phillips should have given the comb length just like Panasonic give.. Overall a great trimmer. Great battery life. Also wash the blades separately.. It is showing waster resistant but water got inside in my trimmer and I had to call customer care to fix it.. Phillips sent their engineer at home and I got it fixed with ease.,4
Bought this at 1350.Awesome thing to use.Easy to use.Best part is charging takes only 1 hr and gives you a whooping usable time of 1.5 hrs. :). Its cordless. Registered on Philips website and got 3 yrs warranty.You can use it before going for an interview.It gives near close cut as shave.Shave is zero where as you can get size 1 cut with this.,5
Good product. Before this trimmer I used 5 trimmers but they didn't have much battery life when I am using its charging is gone. But this trimmer is very good I will keep charging for 30min we can use for 3-4 times for trimming. I buyer this product for 1799/-,5
"Quick delivery, easy to use. It looks quite efficient. I will add more to this review after using it for a month or two. For now the grip is solid, and the trimmer is doing a great job.",5
Very easy to use.. although i have doubts bcz of 1st time. And it does the job very well. Charging is also less time consuming. Build quality good. If any thing happens i will update my review.,5
Just go 4 it.. Its full with pros.... U can use it while charging. Full @60 min. Titanium coated. 2yrs of warranty...,4
"The best beard trimmer available:. + 20 length settings. + It usually lasts for atleast 6-7 full beard trimming. + Trimming option while charging. + Easy to clean. - The blade for first one went out early, but second one is still holding",4
"Awesome product 😍😍. I borrow for my bro this was really very good product at low price i compare market price to Amazon price , i choose Amazon this was really awesome",5
Its an awesome product. Bettery life is the main selling point. In max 10 mns charge one can use it for 15-20 mns i.e. sufficient for one time use. It is very comfortable to use and handy. Noise is also very less. Nice product. I am writing the feedback after one week of purchase. Hope its runs well.,5
"Awesome build quality and features. There is just one issue - long hair or beard gets clogged in the comb and needs repeated cleaning during the process. Instead the length of the beard or hair should be shortened with the help of an external comb, one the length is reduced, trimmer works seamlessly.",5
"I bought it see the battery usage & charging time required details, though it priced at higher amount compared to other brands. But after using the product for over 6yrs, I can proudly say that Philips is no.1 in trimmers.... Still the trimmings is working and saved me 20k Rs.",5
"This is the best available philips trimmer but the product from an old stock. Itching during the first use. Better take 1000₹ variant as their stocks are new and are not that old.. Pros-. Battery life,just takes 1hr to charge. Trim setting. Cons. Difficult to clean. Blades are too sharp. Itching during first use",3
"I am so surprised with the battery backup it gives. I just forget when I charged it last time. Blade quality is very good. Because of the design, you might face difficulty trimming your beard as you might need to run over the same place multiple (sometimes 8-10 times) times.",5
"Pros:. Good handle to hold and go through.. It's good powerful and I used it for abt half an hour and still it is working.. And without precision I.e. at zero its gives a good trim.. Cons:. It's too sound. While charging and using it for 10 min above, becomes over heat.",4
I purchased the same model 2 years ago and that was more better in quality whereas this time the product is not good in terms of quality.. Inner components eg. Rotator is made of aluminium and not of steel as in prior order. Also the working is not smooth.,5
"After using more than 2 years my experience is quite good.. Pros-. Quite efficient battery, charges fast.. Good ergonomics , easy to handle. Cons-. Little more noisy than expected.. It spreads all the shaving all around. Though not a very big issue but better to have one with a collection box inbuilt.",4
"been using it from past 3 years,. pros:. 1. trimmer been working perfectly fine. 2. doesn't require any kind of maintenance like oiling. Note: trimmer's battery got some issue lately, I don't know if it a problem with the button itself or the battery, It's only usable when plugged in :)",4
Reviewing after 5 years of usage.. Battery die after 4 years but works with cord .. Overall very good product. Easy to clean. Sharp & rust resistant titanium blade.. 2 meter charger cord. Carrying pouch is good. Comb is good but it needs care as it is not avilable as spare part in market.,5
Best trimmer.. I've been using it from 5 years. Even now also the trimmer works as it was working on first day only battery is discharging quickly after 5 years of use.. Charge very quickly.. Smooth in functioning.. Water resistant..,5
5 star for instrument but 1 star for plastic cap which is made of very poor material.. It breaks and breaks and breaks again and again.. I need to join it using fevikwik. Atleast we hope better quality from brand such as Phillips.. For such a cost the accessories provided must have a better quality..,3
"I did a lot of research and finally zeroed down on this. I chose this after considering the following:. 1. Battery Backup: This trimmer charges really fast and ergonomics are no doubt GREAT!!!!! With an hour of charge, you can get up to 90 minutes of cordless use with this. 2. Corded/Cordless use: One can connect the charger to this trimmer and use it on mains current even while it's on charging.. 3. Titanium blades: it's not a marketing gimmick, one can really feel the difference. Gives a near close trim to your beard... almost like a 2 day old beard.",5
"I have used this product over a period o f time now and have decided to rate it after thorouly checking it out.. The product is great... Really smooth and doesn't cut skin.. What surprises me is the battery life.. I must have charged only thrice after I had got the trimmer, but have been using it for almost 5 months now... The size is great its easy to carry around and have been very useful in travels... This is a good buy.",5
Well the best feature is that this trimmer can be used both corded and cordless. So if you want to have a quick trim and run out of power it can be used while being plugged in to the power socket. And. it's so comfortable to hold in hand ( ergonomics.). If you register the trimmer on philips website one gets additional year of warranty. So that's 2 +1 years of warranty. I would highly recommend this product. If you consider buying i would say go for it.,5
Very good battery life. Can be used for 6-7 shaves in a single charge and even charges in 30-45 minutes from zero to full. Performance is also good. Overall a good buy.,5
A Great mens grooming product. WORTH the price.. Pros. Convenient to use. easy recharging. good battery backup. Great quality product. Cons. Charger is little low quality. charger should be compatible for other philips trimmer model too..makes it more VERSATILE. OVERALL. GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY,4
"Superb build quality. Have been using it since quite long... Exceptional battery backup... Trim area is bit small yet its an amazing product. Durable, handy, erganomic product..",5
"(OCT 2016)-Great product from phillips as well as from Amazon.. Awosome product, a good trimmer with good battery backup and very fast charging.. The detachable titanium coated cutter blade is washable when removed from body and hence easy to clean and wash.. The length setting function given with the detachable comb allows you very easy and efficient and accurate trimming experience.. Go for it.. Editing review on 19 FEB 2019- its still working great... Awesome battery backup after 3 years... You need to charge it once in a week... (i lost the charger again and again lol) blades are still sharp and dont show any sign of corrosion.",5
Easy to clean. Easy to use. Easy to charge. Long battery life. The charging cable is at least 3 meter long which is very convinient.,5
"After using more then one year there is a review. No compression ... Value for money, must buying .. good battery life ... After all good product..",5
The on-off switch stopped working within a couple of months. I have been using philips products for a long time but this one was not upto the mark.,3
very good trimmer and i got it at 1399 in lightening deal.this is best trimmer and dont go for any other model and brand just to save money.just invest oncee for best performance.moreover i got 1 year extended warrenty by registering on philips website so total there is 3 year warrenty i get and a confirmation mail came to me from philips,5
its a very good product - nice finish. from usage perspective it runs for more time than indicated and does not pull hair like my older one did.. charging is also very fast and it can work while on charging too (tho some said it wont). only issue i find is that it makes hair go everywhere...wish there was a way to collect it on the go and clean just once. but that is issue with most of them not just this product so 5 stars to it,5
"I m writing this review after 3.5 years. My trimmer qt 4011 is still working fine...there is just a drop in battery performance now... But I m replacing batteries with 2 duracell AAA 750 mah batteries.. And my trimmer is now working as fine as before. Excellent performance.. Great durability, great battery life....",5
"Very good and handy product. Trims the beards fast. charging is very fast. Can set in 0.5mm increments.. For new users like me it may take a little time to be habituated.. Caution: water cleaning should be done separately after removing the blades from the body. Else the electrical parts (Motor, battery and switch) may get damaged due to exposure to water.",5
"This product is great, but it needs to improve its precision. It still unable to trim soft beards as per given length.",4
Once again nice product from philips. I had been using philips trimmer from past 4 years n this is my second trimmer from philips. I used to charge My old trimmer for 10 hrs n used to get 45 but this trimmer i charge for an hour and get a battery life more than an hour.. We can easily get to know weather the trimmer is charging if the led is blinking continously or charged if it's not blinking. This is the best trimmer u can get in the in this price range,5
Quality is great and i love everything about this trimmer. Design is very good and handy.. Best thing about this trimmer is it's battery capability and charging time.. It takes around 1 hr to charge and gives 90 mins of trimming.. Overall it's a very good trimmer at this price.,5
Do NOT buy this product!!. The blade says in the description thats its Titanium but its not even close to it.. Its very poky and bruises the skin totally (view my pic I have uploaded). It seems to be a DUPLICATE Philips.. Its not even returnable so you’re money is totally wasted!,1
